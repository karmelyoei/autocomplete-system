adoption of neural net- works. Neural network models promise better sharing of statistical evidence between similar words and inclusion of rich context. This chapter introduces several neural network modeling techniques and explains how they are applied to problems in machine translation 13.1 A Short History Already during the last wave of neural network research in the and machine trans- was in the sight of researchers exploring these methods In the models proposed by and and are striking similar to the current dominant neural machine translation approaches. none of these models were trained on data sizes large enough to produce reasonable results for anything but toy ex- The computational complexity involved by far exceeded the computational resources of that and hence the idea was abandoned for almost two decades. During this hibernation data-driven approaches such as phrase-based statistical ma- chine translation rose from obscurity to dominance and made machine translation a useful tool for many from information to increasing the productivity of professional translators. The modern resurrection of neural methods in machine translation started with the of neural language models into traditional statistical machine translation systems. The work by showed large improvements in public evaluation campaigns. these ideas were only slowly mainly due to computational concerns. The use of for training also posed a challenge for many research groups that simply lacked such hardware or the experience to exploit it. Moving beyond the use in language neural network methods crept into other com- of traditional statistical machine such as providing additional scores or ex- tending translation tables Lu reordering Li 5 6 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION and models and so on. For the joint translation and language model by was since it showed large quality improvements on top of a very competitive statistical machine translation system. More ambitious efforts aimed at pure neural machine abandoning existing approaches completely. Early steps were the use of models and and sequence-to-sequence models These were able to produce reasonable translations for short but fell apart with in- creasing sentence length. The addition of the attention mechanism yielded competitive results Jean With a few more such as byte pair encoding and back-translation of target-side monolingual neural machine translation became the new state of the art. Within a year or the entire research of machine translation went neural. To give some indication of the speed of At the shared task for machine translation organized by the Conference on Machine Translation only one pure neural machine translation system was submitted in 2015. It was but outperformed by traditional statistical systems. A year in a neural machine translation system won in almost all language pairs. In almost all submissions were neural machine translation systems. At the time of neural machine translation research is progressing at rapid pace. There are many directions that are and will be explored in the coming ranging from core machine learning improvements such as deeper models to more linguistically informed models. More insight into the strength and weaknesses of neural machine translation is being gathered and will inform future work. There is an extensive proliferation of available for and of neural machine translation systems.

In many they are not very different from other machine learning methods but have distinct strengths. 13.2. INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS 7 Figure Graphical illustration of a linear model as a feature values are input arrows are and the score is an output node. 13.2.1 Linear Models Linear models are a core element of statistical machine translation. A potential translation x of a sentence is represented by a set of features h i x . Each feature is weighted by a parameter i to obtain an overall score. Ignoring the exponential function that we used previously to turn the linear model into a log-linear the following formula sums up the model. score x j h j x j a linear model can be illustrated by a where feature values are input arrows are and the score is an output node Figure Most we use linear models to combine different components of a machine translation such as the language the phrase translation the reordering and properties such as the length of the or the accumulated jump distance between phrase translations. Training methods assign a weight value i to each such feature h i x related to their importance in contributing to scoring better translations higher. In machine this is called tuning . linear models do not allow us to more complex relationships between the features. Let us say that we that for short sentences the language model is less important than the translation or that average phrase translation probabilities higher than 0.1 are similarly reasonable but any value below that is really terrible. The hypothetical example implies dependence between features and the second example implies non-linear relationship between the feature value and its impact on the score. Linear models cannot handle these cases. A commonly cited counter-example to the use of linear models is the operator with the truth table 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 and 1 1 0 . For a linear model with two features the it is not possible to come up with weights that give the correct output in all cases. Linear models assume that all represented as points in the feature are linearly separable. This is not the case with and may not be the case for type of features we use in machine translation. 8 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Figure A neural network with a hidden layer. 13.2.2 Multiple Layers Neural networks modify linear models in two important ways. The is the use of multiple layers. Instead of computing the output value directly from the input a hidden layer is introduced. It is called because we can observe inputs and outputs in training in- but not the mechanism that connects them this use of the concept hidden is similar to its meaning in hidden Markov models. See Figure 13.2 for on illustration. The network is processed in two steps. a linear combination of weighted input node is computed to produce each hidden node value. Then a linear combination of weighted hidden nodes is computed to produce each output node value. At this let us introduce mathematical notations from the neural network literature. A neural network with a hidden layer consists of a vector of input nodes with values x x 1 x 2 x 3 n T a vector of hidden nodes with values h h 1 h 2 h 3 m T a vector of output nodes with values y y 1 y 2 y 3 l T a matrix of weights connecting input nodes with hidden nodes W w a matrix of weights connecting hidden nodes with output nodes U u The computations in a neural network with a hidden as sketched out so are h j x i w i y k h j u j Note that we in the possibility of multiple output nodes y k although our so far only showed one. 13.2.

We can easily do away with the hidden layer by multiplying out the weights y k h j u j j i x i w u x i u w i j a salient element of neural networks is the use of a non-linear activation function . After computing the linear combination of weighted feature values s j i x i w we obtain the value of a node only after applying such a function h j f s j . Popular choices are the hyperbolic tangent and the logistic function See Figure 13.3 for more details on these functions. A good way to think about these activation functions is that they segment the range of values for the linear combination s j into a segment where the node is turned off close to 0 for or for a transition segment where the node is partly turned on a segment where the node is turned on close to A different popular choice is the activation function for the linear unit It does not allow for negative values and them at but does not alter the value of positive values. It is simpler and faster to compute than x or x You could view each hidden node as a feature detector. For a certain of input node it is turned for others it is turned off.

We do not have to stop at a single hidden layer. The currently fashionable name deep learning for neural networks stems from the fact that often better performance can be achieved by deeply stacking together layers and layers of hidden nodes. 13.2.4 Inference Let us walk through neural network i how output values are computed from input with a concrete example. Consider the neural network in Figure 13.4. This network has one additional innovation that we have not presented so bias units. These are nodes that always have the value 1. Such bias units give the network something to work with in the case that all input values are 0. the weighted sum s j would be 0 no matter the weights. Let us use this neural network to process some say the value 1 for the input node x 0 and 0 for the second input node x 1 . The value of the bias input node x 2 is to 1. To compute the value of the hidden node h 0 we have to carry out the following calculation. h 0 x i w 1 i i 3 0 4 1 0 . 73 The calculations for the other nodes are summarized in Table 13.1. The output value in node y 0 for the input is 0.743. If we expect binary we would understand this result as the value since it is over the threshold of 0.5 in the range of possible output values the output for all possible binary 13.2.

How does it do If we look at the hidden nodes h 0 and h 1 we notice that h 0 acts like the Boolean OR Its value is high if at least of the two input values is 1 h 0 for the three it otherwise has a low value The other hidden node h 1 acts like the Boolean AND it only has a high value if both inputs are 1. XOR is effectively implemented as the subtraction of the AND from the OR hidden node. Note that the non-linearity is key here. Since the value for the OR node h 0 is not that much higher for the input of opposed to a single 1 in the input vs. 0.881 and the distinct high value for the AND node h 1 in this case manages to push the output y 0 below the threshold. This would not be possible if the values of the inputs would be simply summed up as in linear models. As mentioned recently the use of the name deep learning for neural networks has become fashionable. It emphasizes that often higher performance can be achieved by using networks with multiple hidden layers. Our XOR example hints at where this power comes from. With a single input-output layer network it is possible to mimic basic Boolean operations such as AND and OR since they can be modeled with linear XOR can be expressed as x AND y x OR y and our neural network example implements the Boolean operations AND and OR in the and the subtraction in the second layer. For functions that require more intricate more operations may be chained and hence a neural network architecture with more hidden layers may be needed. It may be possible train- to build neural networks for any computer if the number of hidden layers matches the depth of the computation. There is a line of research under the banner neural Turing machines that explores what kind of architectures are needed to implement basic For a neural network with two hidden layers is to implement an algorithm that sorts n -bit numbers. 13.2.5 Back-Propagation Training Training neural networks requires the optimization of weight values so that the network the correct output for a set of training examples. We repeatedly feed the input from the 12 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Optimum Gradient for w 1 Comb Current Point Figure Gradient descent We compute the gradient with regard to every dimension. In this case the gradient with respect to weight w 2 smaller than the gradient with respect to the weight w 1 so we move more to the left than down arrows point in negative gradient pointing to the training examples into the compare the computed output of the network with the correct output from the training and update the weights. several passes over the training data are carried out. Each pass over the data is called an epoch . The most common training method for neural networks is called back-propagation since it updates the weights to the output and propagates back error information to earlier layers. Whenever a training example is then for each node in the an error term is computed which is the basis for updating the values for incoming weights. The formulas used to compute updated values for weights follows principles of gradient descent training. The error for a node is understood as a function of the incoming weights. To reduce the error given this we compute the gradient of the error function with respect to each of the and move against the gradient to reduce the error. Why is moving alongside the gradient a good Consider that we optimize multiple dimensions at the same time. If you are looking for the lowest point in an area you are looking for water in a and the ground falls off steep to the west of and also slightly south of then you would go in a direction that is mainly west and only slightly south. In other you go alongside the gradient. See Figure 13.5 for an illustration. In the following two we will derive the formulae for updating weights for our example network. If you are less interested in the why and more in the how you can skip these sections and continue reading when we summarize the update formulae on page 16. Weights to the output nodes Let us review and extend our notation. At an output node y i we compute a linear combination of weight and hidden node values. s i w i j h j j 13.2. INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS 13 This sum s i is passed through an activation function such as to compute the output value y . y i s i We compare the computed output values y i against the target output values t i from the training example. There are various ways to compute an error value E from these values. Let us use the norm. 1 E t i y i 2 2 i As we stated our goal is to compute the gradient of the error E with respect to the weights w k to out in which direction how we should move the weight value. We do this for each weight w k separately. We break up the computation of the gradient into three essentially unfolding the Equations 13.6 to 13.8. i i Let us now work through each of these three steps. Since we the error E in terms of the output values y i we can compute the component as follows. d 1 2 t i y i t i y i i i 2 The derivative of the output value y i with respect to s i linear combination of weight and hidden node depends on the activation function. In the case of we i d s i s i s i y i y i i i To keep our treatment below as general as possible and not commit to the as an activation we will use the shorthand y i for i below. Note that for any given training example and any given differentiable activation this value can always be computed. we compute the derivative of s i with respect to the weight w i j which turns out to be quite simply the value to the hidden node h j . d i j i j j w i j h j h j Where are In Equations 13.10 to we computed the three steps needed to compute the gradient for the error function given the unfolded laid out in Equation 13.9. Putting it all we have i i j i i i j t i y i y i h j i j i i i j 14 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Factoring in a learning rate gives us the following update formula for weight w i j . Note that we also remove the minus since we move against the gradient towards the minimum. w i j t i y i y i h j It is useful to introduce the concept of an error term i . Note that this term is associated with a while the weight updates concern weights. The error term has to be computed only once for the and it can be then used for each of the incoming weights. i t i y i y i This reduces the update formula w i j i h j Weights to the hidden nodes The computation of the gradient and hence the update formula for hidden nodes is quite anal- As we the linear combination z j s i of input values x k hidden values h j weighted by weights u j k weights w i j z j u j k x k k This leads to the computation of the value of the hidden node h j . h j z j Following the principles of gradient we need to compute the derivative of the error E with respect to the weights u j k . We decompose this derivative as before. j dz j the error is in terms of output values y i not values for hidden nodes h j . The idea behind back-propagation is to track how the error caused by the hidden node contributed to the error in the next layer. Applying the chain rule gives j i i i i i j j k j dz j j k the computation of j is more complex than in the case of output since 13.2. INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS 15 We already encountered the two terms i and previously. To i i d i i i i 1 2 t i y i y 2 i d 1 t i y i 2 y i 2 i t i y i y i i The third term in Equation 13.19 is computed straightforward. i d j j i w i j h j w i j Putting Equation 13.20 and Equation 13.21 Equation 13.19 can be solved j i i w i j This gives rise to a quite intuitive interpretation. The error that matters at the hidden node h j depends on the error terms i in the subsequent nodes y i weighted by w i j the impact the hidden node h j has on the output node y i . Let us tie up the remaining loose ends. The missing pieces from Equation 13.18 are the second term j d z j z j z j h j h j h j dz j dz j and third term dz j d j k j k k u j k x k x k Putting Equation Equation and Equation 13.24 together gives us the gradient j dz j j k j dz j j k i w i j h j x k i If we an error term j for hidden nodes analogous to output nodes j i w i j h j i then we have an analogous update formula u j k j x k i 16 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Summary We train neural networks by processing training one at a and update weights each time. What drives weight updates is the gradient towards a smaller error. Weight updates are computed based on error terms i associated with each non-input node in the network. For output the error term i is computed from the actual output y i of the node for our current and the target output t i for the node. i t i y i y i For hidden the error term j is computed via back-propagating the error term i from subsequent nodes connected by weights w i j . j i w i j h j i Computing y i and h j requires the derivative of the activation to which the weighted sum of incoming values is passed. Given the error weights w i j u j k from each proceeding node h j x k are tempered by a learning rate . w i j i h j u j k j x k Once weights are the next training example is processed. There are typically passes over the training called epochs.

The error on the training set continuously decreases. on a validation set used for at some point the error increases. Training is stopped at the validation minimum before such sets in. 13.2.6 We conclude our introduction to neural networks with some basic and To motivate some of the consider Figure 13.6. While gradient descent training is a it may run into practical problems. Setting the learning rate too high leads to updates that overshoot the optimum. Con- a too low learning rate leads to slow convergence. Bad initialization of weights may lead to long paths of many update steps to reach the optimum. This is especially a problem with activation functions like which only have a short interval of change. The existence of local optima lead the search to get trapped and miss the global optimum. Validation Set Neural network training proceeds for several full iterations over the training data. When to When we track training we see that the error on the training set continuously decreases. at some point sets where the training data is memorized and not generalized. We can check this with an additional set of called the validation set that is not used during training. See Figure 13.7 for an illustration. When we measure the error on the validation set at each point of we see that at some point this error increases. we stop when the minimum on the validation set is reached. 13.2. INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS 19 Weight Initialization Before training weights are initialized to random values. The values are from a uniform distribution. We prefer initial weights that lead to node values that are in the transition area for the activation and not in the low or high shallow slope where it would take a long time to push towards a change. For for the activation feeding values in the range to the activation function leads to activation values in the range of For the activation commonly used formula for weights to the layer of a network are 1 1 where n is the size of the previous layer. For hidden we chose weights from the range 6 6 where n j is the size of the previous n j size of next layer. Momentum Term Consider the case where a weight value is far from its optimum. Even if most training exam- push the weight value in the same it may still take a while for each of these small updates to accumulate until the weight reaches its optimum. A common trick is to use a momentum term to speed up training. This momentum term m t gets updated at each time step t for each training We combine the previous value of the momentum term m t 1 with the current raw weight update value w t and use the resulting momentum term value to update the weights. For with a decay rate of the update formula changes to m t 0 . 9 m t 1 w t w t w t 1 m t Adapting Learning Rate per Parameter A common training strategy is to reduce the learning rate over time. At the beginning the parameters are far away from optimal values and have to change a but in later training stages we are concerned with and a large learning rate may cause a parameter to bounce around an optimum. But different parameters may be at different stages on the path to their optimal so a different learning rate for each parameter may be helpful. One such called records the gradients that were computed for each parameter and accumulates their square values over and uses this sum to adjust the learning rate. n n n j n j n j n j 20 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION The update formula is based on the sum of gradients of the error E with respect to the weight w at all time steps t g t t . We divide the learning rate for this weight this accumulated sum. w t g t t 2 big changes in the parameter value to big gradients g t lead to a reduction of the learning rate of the weight parameter. Combining the idea of momentum term and adjusting parameter update by their change is the inspiration of Adam another method to transform the raw gradient into a parameter update. there is the idea of which is computed as in Equation 13.36 above. m t 1 m t 1 1 g t there is the idea of the squares of gradients in for adjusting the learning rate. Since raw accumulation does run the risk of becoming too large and hence permanently depressing the learning Adam uses exponential just like for the momentum term. v t 2 v t 1 2 g t 2 The hyper parameters 1 and 2 are set typically close to but this also means that early in training the values for m t and v t are close to their initialization values of 0. To adjust for they are corrected for this bias. m t m t 1 1 t v t v t 1 2 t With increasing training time steps t this correction goes t 1 1 t 1 . Having these pieces in hand rate momentum m t accumulated change v t weight update per Adam is computed as w t m t Common values for the hyper parameters are 1 0 . 9 2 0 . 999 and 10 8 . There are various other adaptation schemes. This is an active area of research. For the second order gradient gives some useful information about the rate of change. it is often expensive to so other shortcuts are taken. g v t 13.2. INTRODUCTION TO NEURAL NETWORKS 21 Dropout The parameter space in which back-propagation learning and its variants are operating is lit- with local optima. The hill-climbing algorithm may just climb a mole hill and be stuck instead of moving towards a climb of the highest mountain. Various methods have been proposed to get training out of these local optima. One currently popular method in neural machine translation is called drop-out . It sounds a bit simplistic and wacky. During some of the nodes of the neural network are ignored. Their values are set to and their associated parameters are not updated. These dropped-out nodes are chosen at and may account for as much as or even more of all the nodes. Training resumes for some number of iterations without the and then a different set of drop-out nodes are selected. The dropped-out nodes played some useful role in the model trained up to the point where they are ignored. After other nodes have to pick up the slack. The end result is a more robust model where several nodes share similar roles. Layer Normalization Layer normalization addresses a problem that arises especially in the deep neural networks that we are using in neural machine where computing proceeds through a large sequence of layers. For some training average values at one layer may become very which feed into the following also producing large output and so on. This is especially a problem with activation functions that do not limit the output to a narrow such as linear units. For other training examples the average values at the same layers may be very small. This causes a problem for training. Recall from Equation that gradient updates are strongly effected by node values. Too large node values lead to exploding gradients and too small node values lead to diminishing gradients. To remedy the idea is to normalize the values on a per-layer basis. This is done by adding additional computational steps to the neural network. Recall that a feed-forward layer consists of the the matrix multiplication of the weight matrix W with the node values from the previous layer h l 1 resulting in a weighted sum s l followed by an activation function such as s l W h l 1 h l h l We can compute the mean and variance of the values in the weighted sum vector s l by H l 1 s H i 1 H l 1 H i 1 s l 2 22 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Using these we normalize the vector s l using two additional bias vectors g and b g where is element-wise multiplication and the difference subtracts the scalar average from each vector element. The formula normalizes the values in s l by shifting them against their average hence ensuring that their average afterwards is 0. The resulting vector is then divided by the variance l . The additional bias vectors give some they may be shared across multiple layers of the same such as multiple time steps in a recurrent neural network will introduce these in Section 13.4.4 on page Mini Batches Each training example yields a set of weight updates w i . We may process all the training examples and only afterwards apply all the updates. But neural networks have the advantage that they can immediately learn from each training example. A training method that updates the model with each training example is called online learning . The online learning variant of gradient descent training is called stochastic gradient descent . Online learning generally takes fewer passes over the training set epochs for con- since training constantly changes the it is hard to we may want to process the training data in accumulate the weight up- and then apply them collectively. These smaller sets of training examples are called mini batches to distinguish this approach from batch training where the entire training set is considered one batch. There are other variations to organize the processing of the training typically motivated by restrictions of parallel processing. If we process the training data in mini then we can the computation of weight update values w but have to synchronize their summation and application to the weights. If we want to distribute training over a number of it is computationally more convenient to break up the training data in equally sized perform online learning for each of the parts using smaller mini and then average the weights. breaking up training this often leads to better results than straightforward linear processing. a scheme called runs several training threads that immediately update even though other threads still use the weight values to compute gradients. While this is clearly violates the safe guards typically taken in parallel it does not hurt in practical experience. Vector and Matrix Operations We can express the calculations needed for handling neural networks as vector and matrix operations. s l l s l l b 13.3.

Such large objects are actually frequently used in today’s neural network Further Readings A good introduction to modern neural network research is the textbook There is also book on neural network methods applied to the natural language processing in general A number of key techniques that have been recently developed have entered the standard of neural machine translation research. Training is made more robust by methods such as drop-out where during training intervals a number of nodes are randomly masked. To avoid exploding or vanishing gradients during back-propagation over several gradients are clipped Layer normalization Ba has similar by ensuring that node values are within reasonable bounds. An active topic of research are optimization methods that adjust the learning rate of gradient descent training.

It can be done even for arbitrarily complex neural network architectures. There are a number of that allow you to the network and it will take care of the rest. In this we will take a close look at how this works. 13.3.1 Neural Networks as Computation Graphs we will take a different look at the networks we are building. We previously represented neural networks as graphs consisting of nodes and their connections Figure 13.4 on page or by mathematical equations such as h W 1 x b 1 y W 2 h b 2 The equations above describe the feed-forward neural network that we use as our running example. We now represent this math in form of a computation graph . See Figure 13.8 for an illustration of the computation graph for our network. The graph contains as nodes the parameters of the models weight matrices W 1 W 2 and bias vectors b 1 b 2 the input x and the mathematical operations that are carried out between them and Next to each we show their values. 13.3. COMPUTATION GRAPHS 25 Neural viewed as computation are any arbitrary connected operations between an input and any number of parameters. Some of these operations may have little to do with any inspiration from neurons in the so we are stretching the term neural networks quite a bit here. The graph does not have to have a nice tree structure as in our but may be any directed graph anything goes as long there is a straightforward processing direction and no cycles. Another way to view such a graph is as a fancy way to visualize a sequence of function calls that take as arguments the previously computed or any combination but have no recursion or loops. Processing an input with the neural network requires placing the input value into the node x and carrying out the computations. In the we show this with the input vector T . The resulting numbers should look familiar since they are the same as when previously worked through this example in Section 13.2.4. Before we move let us take stock of what each computation node in the graph has to accomplish. It consists of the a function that executes its computation operation links to input nodes when processing an the computed value We will add two more items to each node in the following section. 13.3.2 Gradient Computations So we showed how the computation graph can be used process an input value. Now we will examine how it can be used to vastly simply model training. Model training requires an error function and the computation of gradients to derive update rules for parameters. The of these is quite straightforward. To compute the we need to add another computation at the end of the computation graph. This computation takes the computed out- put value y and the given correct output value t from the training data and produces an error value. A typical error function is the norm 12 t y 2 . From the view of the result of the execution of the computation graph is an error value. for the more part update rules for the parameters. Look- at the computation model updates originate from the error values and propagate back to the model parameter. we call the computations needed to compute the up- date values also the backward pass through the opposed to the forward pass that computed output and error. Calculus Refresher In the chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of the of two or more functions. That if f and g are then the chain rule ex- presses the derivative of their composition f g function which maps x to f g x in terms of the derivatives of f and g and the product of functions as f g f g g . This can be written more explicitly in terms of the variable. Let F f g or 26 CHAPTER 13.

To compute the update rule for the pa- matrix W 2 we view the error as a function of these parameters and take the derivative with respect to in our case W 2 we broke it up into steps using the chain rule. We now do the same here. d W 2 d sum prod W 2 b 2 t d t d s d sum b 2 d prod W 2 2 2 2 Note that for the purpose for computing an update rule for W 2 we treat all the other in this computation target value t the bias vector b 2 the hidden node values h as constants. This breaks up the derivative of the error with respect to the parameters W 2 into a chain of derivatives along the line of the nodes of the computation graph. all we have to do for gradient computations is to come up with derivatives for each node in the computation graph. In our example these are d t t y d s s s d sum b 2 b 2 d prod W 2 2 h 2 2 h If we want to compute the gradient update for a parameter such as W 2 we compute values in a backward starting from the error term y .

Network nodes representing the context words have connections to a hidden which connects to the out- put layer for the predicted word. Representing Words We are immediately faced with a How do we rep- resent Nodes in a neural network carry real-numbered but words are discrete items out of a very large vocabulary. We cannot simply use token since the neural network will assume that token 124,321 is very similar to token 124,322 while in practice these are completely arbitrary. The same arguments applies to the idea of using bit encoding for token IDs. The words 1 1 1 0 0 0 T and 1 1 1 0 0 0 T have very similar but may have nothing to do with each other. While the idea of using such bit vectors is occasionally it does not appear to have any over what we consider next. we will represent each word with a high-dimensional one dimension per word in the and the value 1 for the dimension that matches the and 0 for the rest. The type of vectors are called one hot vector . For dog 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ... T cat 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ... T eat 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... T 13.4.

These are very large and we will continue to wrestle with the impact of this choice to represent words. One stopgap is to limit the vocabulary to the most 20,000 and pool all the other words in an OTHER token. We could also use word classes automatic clusters or linguistically motivated classes such as part-of-speech to reduce the of the vectors. We will revisit the problem of large vocabularies later. To pool evidence between we introduce another layer between the input layer and the hidden layer. In this each context word is individually projected into a lower space. We use the same weight matrix for each of the context thus generating a continuous space representation for each independent of its position in the conditioning context. This representation is commonly referred to as word embedding . Words that occur in similar contexts should have similar word For if the training data for a language model frequently contains the n-grams but the cute dog jumped but the cute cat jumped child hugged the cat tightly child hugged the dog tightly like to watch cat videos like to watch dog videos then the language model would from the knowledge that dog and cat occur in similar contexts and hence are somewhat interchangeable. If we like to predict from a context where dog occurs but we have seen this context only with the word cat then we would still like to treat this as positive evidence. Word enable generalizing between words and hence having robust predictions in unseen contexts 34 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Neural Network Architecture See Figure 13.11 for a visualization of the architecture the fully feed forward neural network language consisting of the context words as one- hot-vector input the word embedding the hidden layer and predicted output word layer. The context words are encoded as one-hot vectors. These are then passed through the embedding matrix C resulting in a vector of point the word embedding. This embedding vector has typically in the order of 500 or 1000 nodes. Note that we use the same embedding matrix C for all the context words. Also note that mathematically there is not all that much going on here. Since the input to the multiplication to the matrix C is a one hot most of the input values to the matrix multiplication are zeros. we are selecting the one column in the matrix that corresponds to the input word ID. there is no use for an activation function here. In a the embedding matrix a lookup table C w j for word indexed by the word ID w j .

Equation 13.57 is replaced by s W h U C w j j Their paper reports that having such direct connections from context words to output words speeds up although does not ultimately improve performance. We will en- counter the idea of short-cutting hidden layers again a bit later when we discuss deeper models with more hidden layers. They are also called residual connections skip connections or even highway connections . 13.4. NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS 35 Training We train the parameters of a neural language model embedding weight bias by processing all the n-grams in the training corpus. For each we feed the context words into the network and match the network’s output against the one- hot vector of the correct word to be predicted. Weights are updated using back-propagation will go into details in the next Language models are commonly evaluated by which is related to the probability given to proper English text. A language model that likes proper English is a good language model. the training objective for language models is to increase the likelihood of the training data. During given a context x w n 4 w n 3 w n 2 w n 1 we have the correct value for the 1-hot vector y . For each training example x y likelihood is as L x y W y k log p k k Note that only one value y k is the others are 0. So this really comes down to the probability p k given to the correct word k . likelihood this way allows us to update all also the one that lead to the wrong output words. 13.4.2 Word Embedding Before we move it is worth the role of word in neural machine trans- and many other natural language processing tasks. We introduced them here as compact encoding of words in relatively high-dimensional say 500 or 1000 point In the of natural language at the time of this word have acquired the reputation of almost magical quality. Consider the role they play in the neural language language that we just described. They represent context words to enable prediction the next word in a sequence. Recall part of our earlier but the cute dog jumped but the cute cat jumped Since dog and cat occur in similar their on predicting the word jumped should be similar. It should be different from words such as dress which is unlikely to trigger the completion jumped . The idea that words that occur in similar contexts are semantically similar is a powerful idea in lexical semantics. At this point in the researchers love to cite John Rupert You shall know a word by the company it keeps. as Ludwig Wittgenstein put it a bit more 36 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Figure Word projected into Semantically similar words occur close to each other. The meaning of a word is its use. Meaning and semantics are quite concepts with largely unresolved The idea of distributional lexical semantics is to word meaning by their distributional prop- in which contexts they occur. Words that occur in similar contexts dog and cat should have similar representations. In vector space such as the word that we use similarity can be measured by a distance the cosine distance the angle between the vectors. If we project the high-dimensional word down to two we can visualize word as shown in Figure 13.12. In this words that are similar festival are clustered together. But why stop We would like to have semantic representations so we can carry out semantic inference such as queen king queens queen Indeed there is some evidence that word embedding allow just that we better stop here and just note that word are a crucial tool in neural machine translation. 13.4. NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS 37 13.4.3 Inference and Training Training a neural language model is computationally expensive. For billion word even with the use of training takes several days with modern compute clusters. Even using a neural language model as a scoring component in statistical machine translation decoding requires a lot of computation. We could restrict its use only to re-ranking n-best lists or or consider more methods for inference and training. Caching for Inference with a few it is actually possible to use this neural language model within the decoder. Word are for the so do not actually need to carry out the map- ping from one-hot vectors to word but just store them beforehand. The computation between and the hidden layer can be also partly carried out Note that each word can occur in one of the 4 slots for conditioning context a 5-gram language For each of the we can the matrix multiplication of word embedding vector and the corresponding of weights. at run we only have to sum up these at the hidden layer and apply the activation function. Computing the value for each output node is insanely since there are as many output nodes as vocabulary items. we are interested only in the score for a given word that was produced by the translation model. If we only compute its node we have a score that we can use. The last point requires a longer discussion. If we compute the node value only for the word that we want to score with the language we are missing an important step. To obtain a proper we need to normalize which requires the computation of the values for all the other nodes. We could simply ignore this problem and use the scores at face value. More likely words given a context will get higher scores than less likely and that is the main objective. But since we place no constraints on the we may work with models where some contexts give high scores to many while some contexts do not give preference for any. It would be if the node values in the layer were already normalized probabilities. There are methods to enforce this during training. Let us discuss training in and then move to these methods in Section 13.4.3. Noise Estimation We discussed earlier the problem that computing ties with a neural language model is very expensive due to the need to normalize the output node values y i using the function. This requires computing values for all output even if we are only interested in the score for a particular n-gram. To overcome the need for 38 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION this explicit normalization we would like to train a model that already has y i values that are normalized. One way is to include the constraint that the normalization factor Z x j e s j is close to 1 in the objective function. instead of the just the simple likelihood we may include the norm of the log of this factor. Note that if log Z x 0 then Z x 1 . L x y W y k log p k log 2 Z x k Another way to train a self-normalizing model is called noise estimation. The main idea is to optimize the model so that it can separate correct training examples from created noise examples. This method needs less computation during since it does not require the computation of all output node values. we are trying to learn the model distribution p m y x W . Given a noise p n y x in our case of language modeling a model p n y is a good choice we generate a set of noise examples U n in addition to the correct training examples U t . If both sets have the same size U n U t then the probability that a given example x y U n U t is predicted to be a correct training example is p correct x y p m y x W p m y x W p n y x The objective of noise estimation is to maximize p correct x y for correct train- examples x y U t and to minimize it for noise examples x y U n . Using log- we the objective function as L 1 2 U t x y U t log p correct x y 1 2 U n x y U n log p correct x y Returning the the original goal of a self-normalizing note that the noise p n y x is normalized. the model distribution is encouraged to produce values. If p m y x W would generally overshoot y p m y x W 1 then it would also give too high values for noise examples. generally undershooting would give too low values to correct translation examples. Training is since we only need to compute the output node value for the given train- and noise examples there is no need to compute the other since we do not nor- with the function. Given the of the training objective L we have now a complete computation graph that we can implement using standard deep learning as we have done before. These via gradient descent training its It may not be immediately obvious why optimizing towards classifying correct against noise examples gives rise to a model that also predicts the correct probabilities for n-grams. But this is a variant of methods that are common in statistical machine translation in the tuning phase. MIRA infused relaxation and PRO ranked follow the same principle. compute the gradients for all parameters W and use them for parameter updates 13.4.

In large 20-gram have been reported to be used. instead of using a context word recurrent neural networks may condition on context sequences of any length. The trick is to re-use the hidden layer when predicting word w n as additional input to predict word w n 1 . See Figure 13.13 for an illustration. the model does not look any different from the feed-forward neural language model that we discussed so far. The inputs to the network is the word of the sentence w 1 and a second set of neurons which at this point indicate the start of the sentence. The word embedding of w 1 and the start-of-sentence neurons map into a hidden layer h 1 which is then used to predict the output word w 2 . This model uses the same architecture as Words and are represented with one-hot word and the hidden layer 500 real valued neurons. We use a activation function at the hidden layer and the function at the output layer. Things get interesting when we move to predicting the third word w 3 in the sequence. One input is the directly preceding now word w 2 as before. the neurons in the network that we used to represent start-of-sentence are now with values from the hidden layer of the previous prediction of word w 2 . In a these neurons encode the 40 CHAPTER 13.

They are enriched at each step with information about a new input word and are hence conditioned on the full history of the sentence. even the last word of the sentence is conditioned in part on the word of the sentence. the model is it has less weights than a 3-gram feed-forward neural language model. How do we train such a model with arbitrarily long One At the initial stage the second word from the we have the same architecture and hence the same training procedure as for feed-forward neural networks. We assess the error at the output layer and propagate updates back to the input layer. We could process every training example this way essentially by treating the hidden layer from the previous training example as input the current example. this we never provide feedback to the representation of prior history in the hidden layer. The back-propagation through time training procedure Figure unfolds the re- current neural network over a number of by going back 5 word Note despite limiting the unfolding to 5 time the network is still able to learn dependencies over longer distances. Back-propagation through time can be either applied for each training example called time but this is computationally quite expensive. Each time computations have to be carried out over several steps. we can compute and apply weight updates in mini- batches Section we process a larger number of training examples or the entire and then update the weights. Given modern compute fully unfolding the recurrent neural network has become more common. While recurrent neural networks have in theory arbitrary given a training its size is actually known and so we can fully construct the com- graph for each given training the error as the sum of word prediction and then carry out back-propagation over the entire sentence. This does require that we can quickly build computation graphs so-called dynamic computation graphs which is currently supported by some better than others. 13.4. NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS 41 13.4.5 Long Short-Term Memory Models Consider the following step during word prediction in a sequential language After much economic progress over the the country has The directly preceding word country will be the most informative for the prediction of the word has all the previous words are much less relevant. In the importance of words decays with distance. The hidden state in the recurrent neural network will always be updated with the most recent and its memory of older words is likely to diminish over time. But more distant words are much more as the following example The country which has made much economic progress over the years still has In this the of the verb have depends on the subject country which is separated by a long subordinate clause. Recurrent neural networks allow modeling of arbitrarily long sequences. Their architecture is very simple. But this simplicity causes a number of problems. The hidden layer plays double duty as memory of the network and as continuous space representation used to predict output words. While we may sometimes want to pay more attention to the directly previous and sometimes pay more attention to the longer there is no clear mechanism to con- that. If we train the model on long then any update needs to back propagate to the beginning of the sentence. propagating through so many steps raises concerns that the impact of recent information at any step drowns out older information. 6 The rather confusingly named long short-term memory neural network addresses these issues. Its design is quite although it is not very to use in practice. A core distinction is that the basic building block of the so-called cell contains an explicit memory state. The memory state in the cell is motivated by digital memory cells in ordinary computers. Digital memory cells offer operations to and reset. While a digital memory cell may store just a single a cell stores a real number. the operations in a cell are regulated with a real which are called gates Figure 6 Note that there is a corresponding exploding gradient where over long distance gradient values become too large. This is typically suppressed by clipping limiting them to a maximum value set as a hyper parameter. 42 CHAPTER 13.

The input to layer is computed in the same way as the input to a recurrent neural network node. Given the node values for the prior layer x t and the values for the hidden layer from the previous time step h t 1 the input value is the typical combination of matrix multiplication with weights W x and W h and an activation function g . input t g W x x t W h h t 1 13.4. NEURAL LANGUAGE MODELS 43 But how are the gate parameters They actually play a fairly important role. In par- we would like to give preference to recent input input 1 rather re- past memory forget 1 or pay less attention to the cell at the current point in time output 0 this decision has to be informed by a broad view of the context. How do we compute a value from such a complex conditioning we treat it like a node in a neural network. For each gate a input forget output we matrices W W ha and W ma to compute the gate parameter value by the multiplication of weights and node values in the previous layer x t the hidden layer h t 1 at the previous time and the memory states at the previous time step memory t 1 followed by an activation function h . gate a h W x t W ha h t 1 W ma memory t 1 are trained the same way as recurrent neural using back-propagation through time or fully unrolling the network. While the operations within a cell are more complex than in a recurrent neural all the operations are still based on matrix and differentiable activation functions. we can compute gradients for the objective function with respect to all parameters of the model and compute update functions. 13.4.6 Gated Recurrent Units cells add a large number of additional parameters. For each gate multiple weight matrices are added. More parameters lead to longer training times and risk As a simpler gated recurrent units have been proposed and used in neural translation models. At the time of cells seem to make a comeback in neural machine but both are still commonly used. See Figure 13.16 for an illustration for cells. There is no separate memory just a hidden state that serves both purposes. there are only two gates. These gates are predicted as before from the input and the previous state. update t g W update input t U update state t 1 bias update reset t g W reset input t U reset state t 1 bias reset The gate is used in the combination of the input and previous state. This is combination is identical to traditional recurrent neural except that the previous states impact is scaled by the reset gate. Since the gate’s value is between 0 and this may give preference to the current input. combination t f W input t U reset t state t 1 the update gate is used for a interpolation of the previous state and the just computed combination. This is done as a weighted where the update gate balances between the two. 44 CHAPTER 13.

In another extreme the update gate is and the new state is mainly determined from the with as much impact from the previous state as the reset gate allows. It may seem a bit redundant to have two operations with a gate each that combine prior state and input. these play different roles. The operation yielding combination t is a classic recurrent neural network component that allows more complex computations in the combination of input and output. The second operation yielding the new hidden state and the output of the unit allows for bypassing of the in- enabling long-distant memory that simply passes through information during back- passes through the thus enabling long-distance dependencies. 13.4.7 Deep Models The currently fashionable name deep learning for the latest wave of neural network research has a real motivation. Large gains have been seen in tasks such as vision and speech recognition due to stacking multiple hidden layers together. More layers allow for more complex just as having sequences of traditional computation components allows for more complex computations such as and multiplication of numbers. While this has been generally recognized for a long modern hardware enabled to train such deep neural networks on real world problems. 13.4.

The input is passed through a few hidden layers before an output prediction is made. In deep stacked the hidden layers are also connected a layer values at time step t depends on its value at time step t 1 as well as the previous layer at time step t . In deep transitional the layers at any time step t are sequentially connected and hidden layer is also informed by the last layer at time step t 1 . And we learned from experiments in vision and speech that having a and even dozens of layers does give increasingly better quality. How does the idea of deep neural networks apply to the sequence prediction tasks common in There are several options. Figure 13.17 gives two examples. In shallow neural the input is passed to a single hidden from which the output is predicted. a sequence of hidden layers is used. These hidden layers h may be deeply stacked so that each layer acts like the hidden layer in the shallow recurrent neural network. Its state is conditioned on its value at the previous time step h t 1 and the value of previous layer in the sequence h 1 . h 1 f 1 h t 1 1 x t layer h f i h t 1 h 1 for i 1 y t f i h prediction from last layer I the hidden layers may be directly connected in deep transitional where the hidden layer h 1 is informed by the last hidden layer at the previous time step h t 1 but all other hidden layers are not connected to values from previous time steps. h 1 f 1 h t 1 x t layer h f i h 1 for i 1 y t f i h prediction from last layer I 46 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION In all these the function f i may be a layer multiplication plus activation an cell or a cell. Experiments with using neural language models in traditional statistical machine have shown with hidden layers While modern hardware allows training of deep they do stretch computational resources to their practical limit. Not only are there more computations in the neural convergence of training is typically slower. Adding skip connections the input directly to the output or the hidden sometimes speeds up but we still talking about a several times longer training times than shallow networks. Further Readings The vanguard of neural network research tackled language models. A prominent reference for neural language model is who implement an n-gram model as a feed-forward neural network with the history words as input and the predicted word as output. introduce such language models to machine translation called space language and use them in similar to the earlier work in speech recognition. propose a number of speed-ups. They made their implementation avail- able as a open source toolkit which also supports training on a graphical processing unit By clustering words into classes and encoding words as pair of class and word-in-class reduce the computational complexity to allow integration of the neural network language model into the decoder. Another way to reduce computational complexity to enable decoder integration is the use of noise estimation by which roughly self-normalizes the output scores of the model during hence removing the need to compute the values for all possible output words. and compare the two techniques class-based word encoding with normalized scores vs. estimation without normalized scores and show that the letter gives better performance with much higher speed. As another way to allow straightforward decoder Wang convert a space language model for a short list of 8192 words into a traditional n-gram language model in format. Wang present a method to merge a continuous space language model with a traditional n-gram language to take advantage of both better estimate for the words in the short list and the full coverage from the traditional model. Finch use a recurrent neural network language model to n-best lists for a system. compare feed-forward with long short-term neural network language a variant of recurrent neural network language showing better performance for the latter in a speech recognition re-ranking task. reports improvements with n-best lists of machine translation systems with a recurrent neural network language model. Neural language model are not deep learning models in the sense that they use a lot of hidden layers. show that having 3-4 hidden layers improves over having just the typical 1 layer. Language Models in Neural Machine Traditional statistical machine translation models have a straightforward mechanism to integrate additional knowledge such as a large out of domain language model. It is harder for end-to-end neural machine translation. add a language model trained on additional monolingual data to this in form of a recurrently 13.5.

We have already done most of the since the most commonly used architecture for neural machine translation is a straightforward extension of neural language models with one an alignment model. 13.5.1 Encoder-Decoder Approach Our stab at a neural translation model is a straightforward extension of the language model. Recall the idea of a recurrent neural network to model language as a sequential process. Given all previous such a model predicts the next word. When we reach the end of the we now proceed to predict the translation of the one word at a time. See Figure 13.18 for an illustration. To train such a we simply concatenate the input and output sentences and use the same method as to train a language model. For we feed in the input and then go through the predictions of the model until it predicts an end of sentence token. How does such a network Once processing reaches the end of the input sentence predicted the end of sentence marker the hidden state encodes its meaning. In other the vector holding the values of the nodes of this hidden layer is the input sentence embedding . This is the encoder phase of the model. Then this hidden state is used to produce the translation in the decoder phase. 48 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION we are asking a lot from the hidden state in the recurrent neural network here. During encoder it needs to incorporate all information about the input sentence. It cannot forget the words towards the end of the sentence. During the decoder not only does it need to have enough information to predict each next there also needs to be some accounting for what part of the input sentence has been already and what still needs to be covered. In the proposed models works reasonable well for short sentences but fails for long sentences. Some minor to this model have been such using the sentence embedding state as input to all hidden states of the decoder phase of the model. This makes the decoder structurally different from the encoder and reduces some of the load from the hidden state during since it does not need to remember anymore the input. Another idea is to reverse the order of the output so that the last words of the input sentences are close to the last words of the output sentence. in the following we will embark on a more improvement of the by explicitly alignment of output words to input words. 13.5.2 Adding an Alignment Model At the time of the state of the art in neural machine translation is a sequence-to- sequence encoder-decoder model with attention. That is a but it is essentially the model we just described in the previous with a explicitly alignment mechanism. In the deep learning this alignment is called attention we are using the words alignment and attention interchangeable here. Since the attention mechanism does add a bit of complexity to the we are now slowly building up to by taking a look at the then the and the attention mechanism. Encoder The task of the encoder is to provide a representation of the input sentence. The input sentence is a sequence of for which we consult the embedding matrix. as in the basic language model described we process these words with a recurrent neural network. This results in hidden states that encode each word with its left all the preceding words. To also get the right we also build a recurrent neural network that runs right- or more from the end of the sentence to the beginning. Figure 13.19 illustrates the model. Having two recurrent neural networks running in two directions is called a bidirectional recurrent neural network . the encoder consists of the embedding lookup for each input word x j and the mapping that steps through the hidden states h j and h j h j f h j E x j h j f h j 1 E x j 13.5. NEURAL TRANSLATION MODELS 49 Input Word Left-to-Right Recurrent Right-to-Left Recurrent Figure Neural machine translation part input encoder. It consists of two recurrent neural running right to left and left to right recurrent neural The encoder states are the combination of the two hidden states of the recurrent neural networks. In the equation we used a generic function f for a cell in the recurrent neural net- work. This function may be a typical feed-forward neural network layer such as f x Ax b or the more complex gated recurrent units or long short term memory cells The original paper proposing this approached used but lately have become more popular. Note that we could train these models by adding a step that predicts the next word in the but we are actually training it in the context of the full machine translation model. Limiting the description to the its output is a sequence of word representations that concatenate the two hidden states h j h j . Decoder The decoder is also a recurrent neural network. It takes some representation of the input con- text on that in the next section on the attention and the previous hidden state and output word and generates a new hidden decoder state and a new output word prediction. See Figure 13.20 for an illustration. we start with the recurrent neural network that maintains a sequence of hidden states s i which are computed from the previous hidden state s i 1 the embedding of the previous output word i 1 and the input context c i we still have to s i f s i 1 i 1 c i there are several choices for the function f that combines these inputs to generate the next hidden linear transforms with activation etc. the choice here matches the encoder. if we use for the then we also use for the decoder. From the hidden state. we now predict the output word. This prediction takes the form of a probability distribution over the entire output vocabulary. If we have a vocabulary 50,000 then the prediction is a 50,000 dimensional each element corresponding to the probability predicted for one word in the vocabulary. 50 CHAPTER 13.

This separates the encoder state progression from s i 1 to s i from the prediction of the output word t i . The is used to convert the raw vector into a probability where the sum of all values is 1. the highest value in the vector indicates the output word token y i . Its word embedding i 1 informs the next time step of the recurrent neural network. During the correct output word y i is so training proceeds with that word. The training objective is to give as much probability mass as possible to the correct output word. The cost function that drives training is hence the negative log of the probability given to the correct word translation. cost log t i y i we want to give the correct word the probability which would mean a negative log probability of but typically it is a lower hence a higher cost. Note that the cost function is tied to individual the overall sentence cost is the sum of all word costs. During inference on a new test we typically chose the word y i with the highest value in t i use its embedding i for the next steps. But we will also explore beam search where the next likely words are selected as y i creating a different conditioning context for the next words. More on that later. 13.5. NEURAL TRANSLATION MODELS 51 Encoder States Attention Input Context Hidden State Output Words Figure Neural machine translation part attention model. Associations are computed between the last hidden state of the decoder and the word representations These are used to compute a weighted sum of encoder states. Attention Mechanism We currently have two loose ends. The decoder gave us a sequence of word representations h j h j h j and the decoder expects a context c i at each step i . We now describe the attention mechanism that ties these ends together. The attention is hard to visualize using our typical neural network but Figure 13.21 gives at least an idea what the input and output relations are. The attention mechanism is informed by all input word representations h j h j and the previous hidden state of the decoder s i 1 and it produces a context state c i . The motivation is that we want to compute an association between the decoder state contains information where we are in the output sentence and each input word. Based on how strong this association or in other words how relevant each particular input word is to produce the next output we want to weight the impact of its word we compute this association with a layer weight vectors w a u a and bias value b a a s i 1 h j w s i 1 u h j b a The output of this computation is a scalar indicating how important input word j is to produce output word i . We normalize this attention so that the attention values across all input words j add up to using the exp a s i 1 h j k exp a s i 1 h k Now we use the normalized attention value to weigh the contribution of the input word representation h j to the context vector c i and we are done. c i h j j 52 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Simply adding up word representation vectors or may at seem an odd and simplistic thing to do. But it is very common practice in deep learning for natural language processing. Researchers have no qualms about using sentence that are simply the sum of word and other such schemes. 13.5.3 Training With the complete model in we can now take a closer look at training. One challenge is that the number of steps in the decoder and the number of steps in the encoder varies with each training example. Sentence pairs consist of sentences of different so we cannot have the same computation graph for each training example but instead have to dynamically create the computation graph for each of them. This technique is called unrolling the recurrent neural and we already discussed it with regard to language models Section The fully unrolled computation graph for a short sentence pair is shown in Figure 13.22. Note a couple of things. The error computed from this one sentence pair is the sum of the errors computed for each word. When proceeding to the next word we use the correct word as conditioning context for the decoder hidden state and the word prediction. the training objective is based on the probability mass given to the correct given a perfect context. There have been some attempts to use different training such as the but they have not yet been shown to be superior. Practical training of neural machine translation models requires which are well suited to the high degree of parallelism inherent in these deep learning models think of the many matrix To increase parallelism even we process several sentence pairs at once. This implies that we increase the of all the state tensors. To given an example. We represent each input word in sentence pair with a vector h j . Since we already have a sequence of input these are lined up in a matrix. When we process a batch of sentence we again line up these matrices into a 3-dimensional tensor. to give another the decoder hidden state s i is a vector for each output word. Since we process a batch of we line up their hidden states into a matrix. Note that in this case it is not helpful to line up the states for all the output since the states are computed sequentially. Recall the computation of the attention mechanism a s i 1 h j W a s i 1 U a h j b a We can pass this computation to the GPU with a matrix of encoder states s i 1 and a 3- dimensional tensor of input h j resulting in a matrix of attention values for the sentence one dimension for the input Due to the massive re-use of values in W a U a and b a as well as the inherent parallelism of this can show their true power. You may feel that we just created a glaring contradiction. we argued that we have to process one training example at a since sentence pairs typically have different and 13.5.

The cost function is computed for each output word and summed up across the sentence. When walking through the the correct previous output words are used as conditioning context. 54 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Figure To make better use of parallelism in we process a batch of training examples at a time. Converting a batch of training examples into a set of mini batches that have similar length. This wastes less computation on words hence computation graphs have different size. we argued for 100 sentence pairs together to better exploit parallelism. These are indeed goals. See Figure 13.23. When batching training examples we have to consider the maxi- mum sizes for input and output sentences in a batch and unroll the computation graph to these maximum sizes. For shorter we the remaining gaps with non-words and keep track of where the valid data is with a mask . This for that we have to ensure that no attention is given to words beyond the length of the input and no errors and gradient updates are computed from output words beyond the length of the output sentence. To avoid wasted computations on a nice trick is to sort the sentence pairs in the batch by length and break it up into mini-batches of similar length. 7 To training consists of the following steps the training corpus avoid undue biases due to temporal or topical Break up the corpus into maxi-batches Break up each maxi-batch into mini-batches Process each gather gradients Apply all gradients for a maxi-batch to update the parameters training neural machine translation models takes about epochs through entire training A common stopping criteria is to check progress of the model on a val- set is not part of the training and halt when the error on the validation set does not improve. Training longer would not lead to any further improvements and may even degrade performance due to 13.5.4 Beam Search Translating with neural translation models proceeds one step at a time. At each we predict one output word. In our we compute a probability distribution over all words. 7 There is a bit of confusion of the technical terms here. the entire training corpus is called a batch as used in the contrast between batch updating and online updating. In that smaller batches with a subset of the are called mini-batches Section 13.2.6 on page we use the term batch maxi-batch for such a and mini-batch for a subset of the subset. 13.5.

We select the most likely word the Its embedding is part of the conditioning context for the next word prediction decoder We then pick the most likely word and move to the next prediction step. Since the model is conditioned on the previous output word Equation we use its word embedding in the conditioning context for the next step. See Figure 13.24 for an illustration. At each time we obtain a probability distribution over words. In this distribution is most often quite only few words or maybe even just one word amass almost all of the probability. In the the word the received the highest so we pick it as the output word. A real example of how a neural machine translation model translates a German sentence into English is shown in Figure 13.25. The model tends to give if not almost mass to the top but the sentence translation also indicates word choice such as believe vs. think or different vs. various There is also ambiguity about grammatical such as if the sentence should start with the discourse connective but or the subject I This process suggests that we perform 1-best greedy search. This makes us vulnerable to the so-called garden-path problem . Sometimes we follow a sequence of words and realize too late that we made a mistake early on. In that the best sequence consists of less probable words initially which are redeemed by subsequent words in the context of the full output. Consider the case of having to produce an idiomatic phrase that is The words of these phrases may be really odd word choices by themselves piece of cake for easy Only once the full phrase is their choice is redeemed. Note that we are faced with the same problem in traditional statistical machine translation models arguable even more so there since we rely on sparser contexts when making for the next words. Decoding algorithms for these models keep a list of the n-best candidate hypotheses expand them and keep the n-best expanded hypotheses. We can do the same for neural translation models. 56 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Input Sentence er clever um seine so Art .

After committing to a short list of output words beam new word predictions are made for each. These differ since the committed output word is part of the conditioning context to make predictions. When predicting the word of the output we keep a beam of the top n most likely word choices. They are scored by their probability. we use each of these words in the beam in the conditioning context for the next word. Due to this we make different word predictions for each. We now multiply the score for the partial translation this point just the probability for the and the probabilities from its word predictions. We select the highest scoring word pairs for the next beam. See Figure 13.26 for an illustration. This process continues. At each time we accumulate word translation giving us scores for each hypothesis. A sentence translation is when the end of sentence token is produced. At this we remove the completed hypothesis from the beam and reduce beam size by 1. Search when no hypotheses are left in the beam. Search produces a graph of as shown in Figure 13.27. It starts with the start of sentence symbol s and its paths terminate with the end of sentence symbol . Given the compete the resulting translations can be obtained by following the back-pointers. The complete hypothesis one that ended with a with the highest score points to the best translation. When choosing among the best we score each with the product of its word prediction probabilities. In we get better results when we normalize the score by the output length of a divide by the number of words. We carry out this normalization after search is completed. During all translations in a beam have the same so the normalization would make no difference. Note that in traditional statistical machine we were able to combine if they share the same conditioning context for future feature functions. This not possible anymore for recurrent neural networks since we condition on the entire output word sequence from the beginning. As a the search graph is generally less diverse than search 58 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Figure Search graph for beam search decoding in neural translation models. At each time the n 6 best partial translations are selected. An output sentence is complete when the end of sentence token is predicted. We reduce the beam after that and terminate when n full sentence translations are completed. Following the back-pointers from the end of sentence tokens allows us to read them off. Empty boxes represent hypotheses that are not part of any complete path. graphs in statistical machine translation models. It is really just a search tree where the number of complete paths is the same as the size of the beam. Further Readings The attention model has its roots in a sequence-to-sequence model. use recurrent neural networks for the approach. use a short- term network and reverse the order of the source sentence before decoding. The seminal work by adds an alignment model called to link generated output words to source which includes conditioning on the hidden state that produced the preceding target word. Source words are represented by the two hidden states of recurrent neural networks that process the source sentence left-to-right and right-to-left. propose variants to the attention mechanism they call attention and also a hard-constraint attention model attention which is restricted to a Gaussian distribution around a input word. To explicitly model the trade-off between source context input and target context already produced target Tu introduce an interpolation weight that scales the impact of the source context state and the previous hidden state and the last word when predicting the next hidden state in the decoder. Tu augment the attention model with a reconstruction step. The generated output is translated back into the input language and the training objective is extended to not only include the likelihood of the target sentence but also the likelihood to the reconstructed input sentence. 13.6 The previous section gave a comprehensive description of the currently most commonly used basic neural translation model architecture. It performs fairly well out of the box for many 13.6.

Since its a number of have been proposed. We will describe them in this section. Some of the are fairly some target particular use cases or data To given one the best performing system at the recent 2017 evaluation campaign used ensemble decoding byte pair encoding to address large added synthetic data derived from monolingual target side data and used deeper models 13.6.1 Ensemble Decoding A common technique in machine learning is to not just build one system for your but multiple ones and then combine them. This is called an ensemble of systems. It is such a successful strategy that various methods have been proposed to systematically build for instance by using different features or different subsets of the data. For neural one straightforward way is to use different or stop at different points in the training process. Why does it The intuitive argument is that each system makes different mistakes. When two systems then they are more likely both rather than both make the same mistake. One can also see the general principle at play in human such as setting up committees to make decisions or the democratic voting in elections. Applying ensemble methods to our case of neural machine we have to address two generating alternate and combining their output. Generating Alternative Systems See Figure 13.28 for an illustration of two methods for the generating alter- native system. When training a neural translation we iterate through the training data until some stopping criteria is met. This is typically a lack of improvements of the cost function applied to a validation set in or the translation performance on that validation set in During we dump out the model at intervals every 10,000 iteration of batch Once training is we can look back at the performance of the 60 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Model Model Model Model 1 2 3 4 Model Average the cat this of fish there dog these Figure Combining predictions from a ensemble of Each model independently predicts a probability distribution over output which are averaged into a combined distribution. model these different stages. We then pick 4 models with the best performance translation quality measured in This is called checkpoint since we select the models at different checkpoints in the training process. Multi-run requires building systems in completely different training runs. As mentioned this can be accomplished by using different random initialization of which leads training to seek out different local optima. We also randomly the training so using different random order will also lead to different training outcomes. Multi-run usually works a good deal but it is also computationally much more expensive. Note that multi-run can also build on checkpoint Instead of combining the end points of we apply checkpoint to each and then combine those ensembles. Combine System Output Neural translation models allow the combination of several systems fairly deeply. Recall that the model predicts a probability distribution over possible output and then com- to one of the words. This is where we combine the different trained models. Each model predicts a probability distribution and we then combine their predictions. The combination is done by simple averaging over the distributions. The averaged distribution is then the basis for selecting an output word. See Figure 13.29 for an illustration. There may be some to weighing the different systems although in our way of generating they will all have very similar so this is not typically done. 13.6. REFINEMENTS 61 with Right-to-Left Decoding One more tweak on the idea of Instead of building multiple systems with different random we can also build one set of system as and then a second set of system where we reverse the order of the output sentences. The second set of systems are called right-to-left although arguably this is not a good name since it makes no sense for languages such as Arabic or Hebrew where the normal writing order is right to left. The deep integration we described just above does not work anymore for the combination of left-to-right and right-to-left since they produce output in different order. we have to resort to . This involves several Use an ensemble of left-to-right systems to generate an n-best list of candidate for each input sentence. Score each candidate translation with the individual left-to-right and right-to-left Combine the scores of the different models for each select the candidate with the best score for each input sentence. Scoring a given candidate translation with a right-to-left system does require the require forced decoding a special mode of running inference on an input but predicting a given output sentence. This mode is actually much closer to training also an output translation is the regular inference. 13.6.2 Large Vocabularies law tells us that words in a language are very unevenly distribution. there is always a large tail of rare words. New words come into the language all the time woke and we also have to deal with a very large inventory of including company names Microsoft On the other neural methods are not well equipped to deal with such large The ideal representations for neural networks are continuous space vectors. This is why we convert discrete objects such as words into such word ultimately the discrete nature of words shows up. On the input we need to train an embedding matrix that maps each word into its embedding. On the output side we predict a probability distribution over all output words. The latter is generally the bigger since the amount of computation involved is linear with the size of the making this a very large matrix operation. neural translation models typically restrict the vocabulary 20,000 to 80,000 words. In initial work on neural machine only the most frequent words were and all others represented by a unknown or other tag. The translation of these rare words was handled with a back-off dictionary. 62 CHAPTER 13.

Figure Byte pair encoding applied to English used 49,500 Word splits are indicated with Note that the data is also and true-cased. The more common approach today is to break up rare words into units . This may seem a bit crude but is actually very similar to standard approaches in statistical machine translation to handle compounds website web site and morphology follow convolutions convolution s It is even a decent approach to the problem of transliteration of names which are traditionally handled by a sub-modular letter translation component. A popular method to create an inventory of units and legitimate words is byte pair encoding . This method is trained on the parallel corpus. the words in the corpus are split into characters original spaces with a special space the most frequent pair of characters is merged this may be t and h into This step is repeated for a given number of times. Each of these steps increases the vocabulary by beyond the original inventory of single characters. The example mirrors quite well the behavior of the algorithm on real-world data sets. It starts with grouping together with frequent letter combinations and then joins frequent words the in of At the end of this the most frequent words will emerge as single while rare words consist of still See Figure 13.30 for an where units are indicated with two symbols After 49,500 byte pair encoding the vast majority of words are while rarer words are broken up the split seem to be motivated pending but mostly they are not Note also the decomposition of the relatively rare name . Further Readings A limitation of neural machine translation models is the burden to support very large vocabularies. To avoid typically the vocabulary is reduced 13.6. REFINEMENTS 63 to a shortlist 20,000 and the remaining tokens are replaced with the unknown word to- ken To translate such an unknown Jean resort to a separate dictionary. Arthur argue that neural translation models are worse for rare words and interpolate a traditional probabilistic bilingual dictionary with the prediction of the neural machine translation model. They use the attention mechanism to link each target word to a distribution of source words and weigh the word translations accordingly. Source words such as names and numbers may also be directly copied into the target. use a so-called switching network to predict either a traditional translation operation or a copying operation aided by a layer over the source sentence. They the training data to change some target words into word positions of copied source words. augment the word prediction step of the neural translation model to either translate a word or copy a source word. They observe that the attention mechanism is mostly driven by semantics and the language model in the case of word but by location in case of copying. To speed up Mi use traditional statistical machine translation word and phrase translation models to the target vocabulary for mini batches. split up all words to sub-word using character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm. 13.6.3 Using Monolingual Data A key feature of statistical machine translation system are language trained on very large monolingual data set. The larger the language the higher translation quality. Language models trained on up to a trillion words crawled from the general web have been used. it is a surprise that the basic neural translation model does not use any additional monolingual its language model aspect conditioning of the previous hidden decoder state and the previous is trained jointly with the translation model aspect on the input Two main ideas have been proposed to improve neural translation models with data. One is to transform additional monolingual translation into parallel data by syn- the missing half of the and the other is to integrate a language model as a component into the neural network architecture. Back Translation Language models improve of the output. Using larger amounts of monolingual data in the target language give the machine more evidence what are common sequences of words and what are not. We cannot use monolingual target side data in our neural translation model since it is missing the source side. one idea is to just synthesize this data by back translation . See Figure 13.31 for an illustration of the steps involved. Train a reverse system that translates from the intended target language into the source language. We typically use the same neural machine translation setup for this as for our just with source and target But we may use any even traditional phrase-based systems. 64 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION reverse system system Figure Creating synthetic parallel data from target-side monolingual train a system in reverse use it to translate target-side monolingual data into the source combine the generated synthetic parallel data with the true parallel data in system building. Use the reverse system to translate target side monolingual creating a synthetic parallel corpus . Combine the generated synthetic parallel data with the true parallel data when building the system. There is an open question on how much synthetic parallel data should be used in relation to the amount of existing true parallel data. there are magnitudes more monolingual data but we also do not want to drown out the actual real data. Successful of this idea used equal amounts of synthetic and true data. We may also generate much more synthetic parallel but then ensure during training that we process equal amounts of each by over-sampling the true parallel data. Adding a Language Model The other idea is to train a language model as a separate component of the neural translation model. train the large language model as a recurrent neural net- work on all available including the target side of the parallel corpus. they add this language model to the neural translation model. Since both language model and translation model predict output the natural point to connect the two models is joining them at that output prediction node in the network by concatenating their conditioning contexts. We expand Equation 13.75 to add the hidden state of the neural language model s i to the hidden state of the neural translation model s i TM the source context c i and the previous English word e i 1 . e i g c i s i TM s i e i 1 When training the combined we leave the parameters of the large neural language model and update only the parameters of the translation model and the layer. The concern is that otherwise the output side of the parallel corpus would overwrite 13.6. REFINEMENTS 65 MT f e f e MT f e Figure Round trip In addition to training two models f e and e f as done traditionally on parallel we also optimize both models to convert a sentence f into e and then restore it back into f using on monolingual data in f . We may add a corresponding round trip starting with e . the memory of the large monolingual corpus. In other the language model would over- to the parallel training data and be less general. One question How much weight should be given to the translation model and how much weight should be given to the language The above equation considers them in all instances the same way. But there may be output words for which the translation model is more relevant the translation of content words with distinct and output words where the language model is more relevant the introduction of relevant function words for The balance of the translation model and the language model can be achieved with the type of gated units that we encountered in our discussion of the long short-term memory neural network architecture Such a gated unit may be predicted solely from the model state s i and then used as a factor that is multiplied with that language model state before it is used in the prediction of Equation 13.82. gate i f s i s i gate i s i e i g c i s i TM s i e i 1 Round Trip Training Looking at the idea from a strict machine learning we can see two learning objectives. There is the objective to learn the transformations given by the parallel as done traditionally. there is the goal to learn how to convert an output sentence into the input and then back into the output language with the objective to match the traditional sentence. A good machine translation model should be able to preserve the meaning of the output language sentence when mapped into the input language and back. See Figure 13.32 for an illustration. There are two machine translation models. One that translates sentences in the language direction f e the other in the opposite direction e f . These two systems may be trained with traditional using a parallel corpus. We can also round trip a sentence f through the f e and then back through e f In this there are two objectives for model training. 66 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION The translation of the given monolingual sentence f should be a valid sentence in the language e as measured with a language model e . The reconstruction of the translation back into the original language f should be as measured with the translation model MT e f f These two objectives can be used to update model parameters in both translation models MT f e and MT e f . Typical model update is driven by correct predictions of each word. In this round-trip the translation has to be computed before we can do the usual training of model MT e f with the given sentence pair f To make better use of the training a n-best list of translations 1 n is computed and model updates are computed for each of them. We can also update the model MT f e with monolingual data in language f by scaling up- dates by the language model cost e i and the forward translation cost MT f e i f for each of the translations i in the n-best list. To use monolingual data in language e training is done in the reverse round trip direction. For details of this refer to Further Readings back-translate the monolingual data into the input and use the obtained synthetic parallel corpus as additional training data. use monolingual data in a dual learning setup. Machine translation engines are trained in both and in addition to regular model training from parallel monolingual data is translated in a round trip e to f to e and evaluated with a language model for language f and reconstruction match back to e as cost function to drive gradient descent updates to the model. 13.6.4 Deep Models Learning the lessons from other research such as vision or speech recent work in machine translation has also looked at deeper models. Simply this involves adding more intermediate layers into the baseline architecture. The core components of neural machine translation are the encoder that takes input words and converts them into a sequence of contextualized representations and the decoder that gen- a output sequence of words. Both are recurrent neural networks. Recall that we already discussed how to build deeper recurrent neural networks for back to Section 13.4.7 on page We now extend these ideas to the recurrent neural networks in the encoder and the decoder. What all these recurrent neural networks have in common is that they process an input sequence into an output and at each time step t information from a new input x t is combined with the hidden state from the previous time step h t 1 to predict a new hidden state h t . From that hidden state additional predictions may be made words y t in the case of the the next word in the sequence in the case of language or the hidden state is used otherwise the attention mechanism in case of the 13.6.

Decoder See Figure 13.33 for part of the decoder in neural machine using a par- deeper architecture. We see that instead of a single hidden state h t for a given time step t we now have a sequence of hidden states h 1 h 2 h for a given time step t . There are various options how the hidden states may be connected. in Sec- 13.4.7 we presented two ideas. In stacked recurrent neural networks where a hidden state h is conditioned on the hidden state from a previous layer h 1 and the hidden state at the same depth from a previous time step h t 1 . In deep transition recurrent neural net- the hidden state h 1 is conditioned on the last hidden state from the previous time step h t 1 and the while the other hidden layers h i 1 are just conditioned on the previous previous layer h 1 . Figure 13.33 combines these two ideas. some layers are both stacked on the previous time step h t 1 and previous layer h 1 while others are deep transitions only on the previous layer h 1 . we can break this out into the stacked layers h h 1 f 1 x t h t 1 1 h f i h 1 h t 1 for i 1 and the deep transition layers v . v 1 g 1 in h t 1 in is either x t or h 1 v g v 1 for j 1 h v 68 CHAPTER 13.

Each of the functions g may be implemented as feed-forward neural network layer multiplication plus activation long-short term memory cell or gated recurrent unit On either each function g has its own set of trainable model parameters. Encoder Deep recurrent neural networks for the encoder may draw in the same ideas as the with one in the baseline neural translation we used bidirectional recurrent neural networks to condition on both left and right context. We want to do the same for any deep version of the encoder. Figure 13.34 shows one idea how this could be called alternating recurrent neural network . It looks basically like a stacked recurrent neural with one the hidden states at each layer h are alternately conditioned on the hidden state from the previous time step h t 1 or the next time step h t . we formulate this as even numbered hidden states h 2 i being conditioned on the left context h t 1 2 i and odd numbered hidden states h 2 i conditioned on the right context h t 2 i . h 1 f x t h t 1 1 h 2 i f h 2 i 1 h t 1 2 i h 2 i f h 2 i h t 2 i As before in the we can extend this idea by having deep transitions. Note that deep models are typically augmented with direct connections from the input to the output. In the case of the this may mean a direct connection from the embedding to the encoder or connections at each layer that pass the input directly to the output. 13.6.

Figure 13.35 shows an example of attention weights given to English input words for each German output word during the translation of a sentence. The attention values typically match up pretty well with word alignment used in statistical machine obtained with tools such as or fast-align which implement variants of the IBM Models. There are several good uses for word alignments beyond their intrinsic value of improving the quality of translations. For instance in the next we will look at using the attention 70 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION mechanism to explicitly track coverage of the input. We may also want to override preferences of the neural machine translation model with translations of certain terminology or expressions such as or measurements that are better handled by rule-based this requires to know when the neural model is about to translate a source word. But also the end user may be interested in alignment such as translators using machine translation in a computer aided translation tool may want to check where an output word originates from. instead of trusting the attention mechanism to implicitly acquire the role as word we may enforce this role. The idea is to provide not just the parallel corpus as train- but also word alignments using traditional means. Such additional information may even training of models to converge faster or overcome data sparsity under low resource conditions. A straightforward way to add such given word alignment to the training process is to not change the model at but to just modify the training objective. the goal of training neural machine translation models is to generate the correct output words. We can add to this goal to also match the given word alignment. we assume to have access to an alignment matrix A that alignment points A input words j and output words i in a way that j A 1 each output word’s alignment scores add up to 1. The model estimates attention scores that also add up to 1 for each output j 1 Equation 13.79 on page The mismatch between given alignment scores A and computed attention scores can be measured in several such as cross entropy cost CE 1 I I J i j A log or mean squared error cost 1 I I J i j A 2 This cost is added to the training objective and may be weighted. Further Readings Chen add supervised word alignment information with traditional statistical word alignment to training. They augment the objective function to also optimize matching of the attention mechanism to the given alignments. 13.6.6 Modeling Coverage One impressive aspect of neural machine translation models is how well they are able to trans- late the entire input even when a lot of reordering is involved. But this as aspect is not occasionally the model translates some input words multiple and sometimes it misses to translate them. 13.6.

See Figure 13.36 for an example. The translation has two related to of attention. The beginning of the phrase alliance receives too much resulting in a faulty translation with hallucinated or the company of the society for social education . At the end of the input the phrase a fresh start does not receive any attention and is hence untranslated in the output. an obvious idea is to more strictly model coverage . Given the attention a reasonable way to coverage is by adding up the attention states. In a complete sentence we roughly expect that each input word receives a similar amount of attention. If some input words never receive attention or too much attention that signals a problem with the translation. Enforcing Coverage during Inference We may restrict the enforcing of proper coverage to the decoder. When considering multiple hypothesis in beam then we should age the ones that pay too much attention to some input words. once hypotheses are we can penalize those that paid only little attention to some of the input. There are various ways to come up with scoring functions for over-generation and under-generation. 72 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION coverage j i k over-generation max 0 under-generation min 1 j coverage j 1 coverage j j The use of multiple scoring functions in the decoder is common practice in traditional machine translation. For it is not in neural machine translation. A challenge is to give proper weight to the different scoring functions. If there are only two or three these can be optimized with grid search over possible values. For more we may borrow methods such as or MIRA from statistical machine translation. Coverage Models The vector that accumulates coverage of input words may be directly used to inform the attention model. the attention given to a input word j was conditioned on the previous state of the decoder s i 1 and the representation of the input word h j . we also add as conditioning context the accumulated attention given to the word to Equation 13.78 on page a s i 1 h j W a s i 1 U a h j V a coverage j b a Coverage tracking may also integrated into the training objective. Taking a page from the guided alignment training the previous Section we augment the training function with a coverage penalty with some weight . log P y i x coverage j 2 i j Note that in it is problematic to add such additional functions to the learning ob- since it does distract from the main goal of producing good translations. Fertility So we described coverage as the need to cover all input words roughly evenly. even the earliest statistical machine translation models considered the fertility of the number of output words that are generated from each input word. Consider the English do not most other language do not require an equivalent of do when negating a verb. other words are translated into multiple output words. For in- the German may be translated as of course thus generating 2 output words. We may augment models of coverage by adding a fertility components that predicts the number of output words for each input words. Here one example for a model that predicts the fertility j for each input and uses it to normalize the coverage statistics. j N W j h j 1 j i k coverage j 13.6. REFINEMENTS 73 Fertility j is predicted with a neural network layer that is conditioned on the input word representation h j and uses a activation function resulting in values from 0 to which is scaled to a maximum fertility of N . Feature Engineering versus Machine Learning The work on modeling coverage in neural machine translation models is a nice example to contrast between the engineering approach and the belief in generic machine learning techniques. From an engineering a good way to improve a system is to analyze its weak points and consider changes to overcome them. we notice over-generation and under-generation with respect to the and add components to the model to overcome this problem. On the other proper coverage is one of the features of a good translation that machine learning should be able to get from the training data. If it is not able to do it may need deeper more robust estimation ways to or or other adjustments to give it just the right amount of power needed for the problem. It is hard to carry out the analysis needed to make generic machine learning given the complexity of a task like machine translation. the argument for deep learning is that it does not require feature such as adding coverage models. It remains to be seen how neural machine translation evolves over the next and if it moves more into a engineering or machine learning direction. Further Readings To better model Tu add coverage states for each input word by either summing up attention scaled by a fertility value predicted from the input word in or learning a coverage update function as a feed-forward neural network layer. This coverage state is added as additional conditioning context for the prediction of the attention state. condition the prediction of the attention state also on the previous context state and also introduce a coverage state with the sum of input source that aims to subtract covered words at each step. separate hidden states that keep track of source coverage and hidden states that keep track of produced output. add a number of biases to model and alignment inspired by traditional statistical machine translation models. They condition the prediction of the attention state on absolute word the attention state of the previous output word in a limited and coverage attention state over a limited window. They also add a fertility model and add coverage in the training objective. 13.6.7 Adaptation Text may differ by degree of and so on. A common problem in the practical development of machine translation systems is that most of the available training data is different from the data relevant to a chosen use case. For if your goal is to translate chat room you will realize that there is very little translated chat room data available. There are massive quantities of publications from international random translations crawled from the and maybe somewhat relevant movie subtitle translations. 74 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION general training data initial training general system in-domain training data adaptation adapted system Figure Online training of neural machine translation models allows a straightforward domain adaptation Having a general domain translation system trained on general-purpose a handful of additional training epochs on in-domain data allows for a domain-adapted system. This problem is generally framed as a problem of domain adaptation . In the simplest you have one set of data relevant to your use case the in-domain data and another set that is less relevant the out-of-domain data . In traditional statistical machine a vast number of methods for domain have been proposed. Models may be we may back-off from in-domain to out-of-domain we may over-sample in-domain data during training or sub-sample out-of-domain etc. For neural machine a fairly straightforward method is currently the most pop- Figure This method divides training up into two stages. we train the model on all available data until convergence. we run a few more iterations of training on the in-domain data only and stop training when performance on the in-domain validate set peaks. This the model from all the training but is still specialized to the in-domain data. Practical experience with this method shows that the second in-domain training stage may converge very quickly. The amount if in-domain data is typically relatively and only a handful of training epochs are needed. less commonly used method draws on the idea of ensemble decoding If we train separate models on different sets of we may combine their just as we did for ensemble decoding. In this we do want to choose weights for each although how to choose these weights is not a trivial task. If there is just an in-domain and out-of-domain this may be simply done by line search over possible values. Let us now look at a few special cases that arise in practical use. in-domain data from large collections A common problem is that the amount of available in-domain data is very so just training on this even in a secondary adaptation risks very good performance on the seen data but poor on everything else. 13.6. REFINEMENTS 75 Large random collections of parallel text often contain data that closely matches the in- domain data. we may want to extract this in-domain data from the large collections of mainly out-of-domain data. The general idea behind a variety of methods is to build two one in-domain detector trained on in-domain and one out-of-domain detector trained on out-of-domain data. We then score each sentence pair in the out-of-domain data with both detectors and select sentence pairs that are preferred judged relatively by the in-domain detector. The classic detectors are language models trained on the source and target side of the in- domain and out-of-domain resulting in a total of 4 language the source side in-domain model in f the target side in-domain model in e the source side out-of-domain model out f and the target side out-of-domain model out e . Any given sentence pair from the out-of-domain data is then scored based on these relevance in e e out e e in f f out f f We may use traditional n-gram language models or neural recurrent language models. Some work suggests to replace open class words with part-of-speech tags or word clusters. More sophisticated models not only consider domain- relevance but noisiness of the training data misaligned or mistranslated We may even use in-domain and out-of-domain neural translation models to score sentence pairs in- stead of source and target side sentences in isolation. The data may be used in several ways. We may only train on this data to build our system. we use it in a secondary adaptation stage as outlined above. Only monolingual in-domain data What if we have no parallel data in the domain of our use Two main ideas have been explored. we may still use the monolingual may it be in the source or target language or for parallel data from a large pile of general as outline above. Another idea is to use existing parallel data to train an out-of-domain then back- translate out-of-domain data Section to generate a synthetic in-domain and then use this data to adapt the initial model. In traditional statistical machine much adaptation success has been achieved with just interpolating the language and this idea is the neural translation equivalent to that. Multiple domains we have multiple collections of data that are clearly by domain typically categories such as information etc. We can use the techniques described above to build specialized translation models for each of these domains. For a given test we then select the appropriate model. If we do not know the domain of the test we have to build a that allows us to automatically 76 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION make this determination. The may be based on the methods for domain detectors described above. Given the decision of the we then select the most appropriate model. But we do not have to commit to a single domain. The may instead provide a distribution of relevance of the domain models domain domain domain which are then used as weights in an ensemble of models. The domain may done based on a whole document instead of each individual which brings in more context to make a more robust decision. As a it is hard to give conclusive advice on how to handle adaptation since it is such a broad topic. The style of the text may be more relevant than its content. Data may differ narrowly publications from the United Nations vs. an- from the European or dramatically chat room vs. published The amounts of in-domain and out-of-domain data differs. The data may be cleanly separated by domain or just come in a massive disorganized pile. Some of the data may be of higher translation quality than which may be polluted by noise such as or even generated by some other machine translation system. Further Readings There is often a domain mismatch between the bulk even of the training data for a translation and its test data during deployment. There is rich literature in traditional statistical machine translation on this topic. A common approach for neural models is to train on all available training and then run a few iterations on in-domain data only and as already pioneered in neural language model adaption demonstrate the effectiveness of this adaptation method with small in-domain sets consisting of as little as 500 sentence pairs. argue that given small amount of in-domain data leads to and suggest to mix in-domain and out-of-domain data during adaption. and identify the same problem and suggest to use an ensemble of baseline models and adapted models to avoid consider alternative training methods for the adaptation phase but do not consistently better results than the traditional gradient descent training. Inspired by domain adaptation work in statistical machine translation on sub-sampling and sentence Chen build an in-domain vs. out-of-domain for sentence pairs in the training and then use its prediction score to reduce the learning rate for sentence pairs that are out of domain. show that traditional statistical machine translation outperforms neural ma- chine translation when training general-purpose machine translation systems on a collection and then tested on niche domains. The adaptation technique allows neural machine translation to catch up. A multi-domain model may be trained and informed at run-time about the domain of the input sentence. apply an idea initially proposed by to augment input sentences for register with a politeness feature token to the domain adaptation problem. They add a domain token to each training and test sentence. Chen report better results over the token approach to adapt to topics by encoding the given topic membership of each sentence as an additional input vector to the conditioning context of word prediction layer. 13.6. REFINEMENTS 77 13.6.8 Adding Linguistic Annotation One of the big debates in machine translation research is the question if the key to progress is to develop relatively machine learning methods that implicitly learn the important features of or to use linguistic insight to augment data and models. Recent work in statistical machine translation has demonstrated the of motivated models. The best statistical machine translation systems in major evaluation campaigns for language pairs such as and are syntax-based. While they translate they also build up the syntactic structure of the output sentence. There have been serious efforts to move towards deeper semantics in machine translation. The turn towards neural machine translation was at hard swing back towards better machine learning while ignoring much linguistic insights. Neural machine translation views translation as a generic sequence to sequence which just happens to involve sequences of words in different languages. Methods such as byte pair encoding or character-based models even put the value of the concept of a word as a basic unit into doubt. recently there have been also attempts to add linguistic annotation into neural translation and steps towards more linguistically motivated models. We will take a look at successful efforts to integrate linguistic annotation to the input linguistic annotation to the output and build linguistically structured models. Linguistic annotation of the input One of the great of neural networks is their to cope with rich context. In the neural machine translation models we each word prediction is conditioned on the entire input sentence and all previously generated out- put words. Even as it is typically the a input sequence and partially generated output sequence has never been observed before during the neural model is able to generalize the training data and draw from relevant knowledge. In traditional statistical mod- this required carefully chosen independence assumptions and back-off schemes. adding more information to the conditioning context in neural translation models can be accommodated rather straightforwardly. what information would be like to The typical linguistic treasure chest contains part-of-speech morphological properties of syntactic phrase syntactic and maybe even some semantic annotation. All of these can be formatted as annotations to individual input words. this requires a bit more such as syntactic and semantic annotation that spans multiple words. See Figure 13.38 for an example. To just walk through the linguistic annotation of the word girl in the Part of speech is a noun. Lemma is girl the same as the surface form. The lemma differs for watched watch . Morphology is singular. 78 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Words the girl watched attentively the beautiful Part of speech ADV Lemma the girl watch attentive the beautiful Morphology SING .

The word is not part of a verb phrase OTHER Its syntactic head is watched . The dependency relationship to the head is subject SUBJ Its semantic role is ACTOR . There are many schemes of semantic types. For instance girl could be as MAN . Note how phrasal annotations are handled. The noun phrase is the girl . It is common to use an annotation scheme that tags individual words in a phrasal as BEGIN and CONTINUATION INTERMEDIATE while words outside such phrases as OTHER . How do we encode the word-level factored Recall that words are initially represented as 1-hot vectors. We can encode each factor in the factored representation as a 1- hot vector. The concatenation of these vectors is then used as input to the word embedding. Note that mathematically this that each factor of the representation is mapped to a embedding and the word embedding is the sum of the factor Since the input to the neural machine translation system is still a sequence of word embed- we do not have to change anything in the architecture of the neural machine translation model. We just provide richer input representations and hope that the model is able to learn how to take advantage of it. Coming back to the debate about linguistics versus machine learning. All the linguistic an- notation proposed here can arguable be learned automatically as part of the word contextualized word in the hidden encoder This may or may not be true. But it does provide additional knowledge that comes from the tools that produce the an- notation and that is particularly relevant if there is not enough training data to automatically induce it. why make the job harder for the machine learning algorithm than In other why force the machine learning to discover features that can be readily 13.6.

Linguistic annotation of the output What we have done for input words could be done also for output words. Instead of discussing the points about what adjustments need to made separate for each output let us take a look at another annotation scheme for the output that has been successfully applied to neural machine translation. Most syntax-based statistical machine translation models have focused on adding syntax to the output side. Traditional n-gram language models are good at promoting among neighboring they are not powerful enough to ensure overall of each output sentence. By designing models that also produce and evaluate the syntactic parse for each output syntax-based models give the means to promote grammatically correct output. The word-level annotation of phrase structure syntax suggested in Figure 13.38 is rather crude. The nature of language is and annotating nested phrases cannot be easily handled with a BEGIN CONT OTHER scheme. typically tree structures are used to represent syntax. See Figure 13.39 for an example. It shows the phrase structure syntactic parse tree for our example sentence The girl watched attentively the beautiful . Generating a tree structures is generally a quite different process than generating a sequence. It is typically built recursively bottom-up with algorithms such as chart parsing. we can the parse tree into a sequence of words and structural tokens that indicate the beginning NP and end closing parenthesis of syntactic phrases. forcing syntactic parse tree annotations into our sequence-to-sequence neural ma- chine translation model may be done by encoding the parse structure with additional output tokens. To be perfectly the idea is to produce as the output of the neural translation not just a sequence of but a sequence of a mix of output words and special tokens. 80 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION The hope is that forcing the neural machine translation model to produce syntactic structure in a encourages it to produce syntactically well-formed output. There is some evidence to support this despite the simplicity of the approach. Linguistically structured models The of syntactic parsing has not been left untouched by the recent wave of neural networks. The previous section suggests that syntactic parsing may be done as simply as framing it as a sequence to sequence with additional output tokens. the best-performing syntactic use model structures that take the recur- nature of language to heart. They are either inspired by networks and build parse trees or are neural versions of left-to-right push-down that main- a stack of opened phrases that any new word may extend or or be pushed down the stack to start a new phrase. There is some early work on integrating syntactic parsing and machine translation into a framework but no consensus on best practices has emerged yet. At the time of this is clearly still a challenge for future work. Further Readings Wu propose to use factored representations of words and part of with each factor encoded in a one-hot in the input to a recurrent neural network language model. and use such representations in the input and output of neural machine translation demonstrating better translation quality. 13.6.9 Multiple Language Pairs There are more than two languages in the world. And we also have training data for many language sometimes it is highly overlapping European Parliament proceedings in 24 sometimes it is unique Canadian in French and For some language a lot of training data is available But for most language there is only very including commercially interesting language pairs such as or There is a long history of moving beyond languages and encode meaning language- sometimes called In machine the idea is to map the input language into an and then map the into the output language. In such a we have to build just one mapping step into and one step out of the for each language. Then we can translate between it and all the other languages for which we have done the same. Researchers in deep learning often do not hesitate to claim that intermediate states in neural translation models encode semantics or meaning. can we train a neural machine translation system that accepts text in any language as input and translates it into any other 13.6. REFINEMENTS 81 Multiple Input Languages Let us we have two parallel one for and one for We can train a neural machine translation model on both corpora at the same time by simply concatenating them. The input vocabulary contains both German and French words. Any input sentence will be quickly recognized as being either German or due to the sentence words such as you in of in The combined model trained on both data sets has one advantage over two separate mod- It is exposed to both English sides of the parallel corpora and hence can learn a better language model. There may be also be general to having diversity in the leading to more robust models. Multiple Output Languages We can do the same trick for the output by a and a corpus. But given a French input sentence during how would the system know which output language to A crude but effective way to signal this to the model is by adding a tag like SPANISH as token of the input sentence. ENGLISH pas Is this not a case of double SPANISH pas verse con If we train a system on the three corpora mentioned and we can also use it translate a sentence from German to Spanish without having ever presented a sentence pair as training data to the system. SPANISH verse con For this to there has to be some representation of the meaning of the input sentence that is not tied to the input language and the output language. experiments show that this actually does somewhat. To achieve good some parallel data in the desired language pair is but much less than for a standalone model Figure 13.40 summarizes this idea. A single neural machine translation is trained on parallel corpora in resulting in a system that may translate between any seen input and output language. It is likely that increasingly deeper models Section may better serve as multi-language since their deeper layer compute more abstract rep- of language. The idea of marking the output language with a token such as SPANISH has been explored more widely in the context of systems for a single language pair. Such tokens may represent the domain of the input sentence or the required level of politeness of the output sentence 82 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION French German MT English Spanish Figure Multi-language machine translation system trained on one language pair at a rotating through many of them. After training on and it is even able to translate from German to Spanish. Sharing Components Instead of just throwing data at a generic neural machine translation we may want to more carefully consider which components may be shared among models. The idea is to train one model per language but some of the components are identical in these unique models. The encoder may be shared in models that have the same input language. The decoder may be shared in models that have the same output language. The attention mechanism may be shared in all models for all language pairs. Sharing components means is that the same parameter values are used in these separate models. Updates to them when training a model for one language pair then also changes them for in the model for the other language pairs. There is no need to mark the output since each model is trained for a language pair. The idea of shared training of components can also be pushed further to exploit mono- lingual data. The encoder may be trained on monolingual input language but we will need to add a training objective language model the decoder may be trained in isolation with monolingual language model data. since there are no context states these have to be blanked which may lead it to learn to ignore the input sentence and function only as a target side language model. Further Readings Johnson explore how well a single canonical neural translation model is able to learn from multiple to multiple by simultaneously training on on parallel corpora for several language pairs. They show small for several input languages with the same output mixed results for translating into multiple output languages by an additional input language The most interesting result is the ability for such a model to translate in language directions for which no parallel corpus is thus demonstrating that some meaning representation is although less well than using traditional pivot methods. support multi-language input and output by training encoders and decoders and a shared attention mechanism. 13.7.

But this is by no means the only architecture for neural networks. a vantage of using recurrent neural networks on the input side is that it requires a long sequential process that consumes each input word in one step. This also prohibits the ability to the processing of all words at thus limiting the use of the capabilities of There have been a few alternate suggestions for the architecture of neural machine models. We will present some of them in this section. It remains to be if they are a curiosity or conquer the 13.7.1 Neural Networks The end-to-end neural machine translation model of the modern era and was actually not based on recurrent neural but based on neural networks . These had been shown to be very successful in image thus looking for other applications was a natural next step. See Figure 13.41 for an illustration of a network that encodes an input sen- The basic building block of these networks is a convolution. It merges the representation of i input words into a single representation by using a matrix K i . Applying the convolution to every sequence of input words reduces the length of the sentence representation by i 1 . Repeating this process leads to a sentence representation in a single vector. The illustration shows an architecture with two K i followed by a L i layer that merges the sequence of phrasal representations into a single sentence The size of the kernels K i and L i depends on the length of the sentences. The example shows a 6-word sentence and a sequence of K 2 K 3 and L 3 layers. For longer bigger kernels are needed. The hierarchical process of building up a sentence representation bottom-up is well grounded in linguistic insight in the recursive nature of language. It is similar to chart except that we are not committing to a single hierarchical structure. On the other we are asking an 84 CHAPTER 13.

Convolutions do not result in a single sentence embedding but a sequence. The encoder is also informed by a recurrent neural network from output word to decoding layer. awful lot from the resulting sentence embedding to represents the meaning of an entire sen- of arbitrary length. Generating the output sentence translation reverses the bottom-up process. One problem for the decoder is to decide the length of the output sentence. One option to address this problem is to add a model that predicts output length from input length. This then leads to the selection of the size of the reverse convolution matrices. See Figure 13.42 for an illustration of a variation of this idea. The shown architecture always uses a K 2 and a K 3 resulting in a sequence of phrasal not a single sentence embedding. There is an explicit mapping step from phrasal representations of input words to phrasal representations of output called transfer layer. The decoder of the model includes a recurrent neural network on the output side. Sneaking in a recurrent neural network here does undermine a bit the argument about better the claim still holds true for encoding the and a sequential language model is just a too powerful tool to disregard. While the just-described neural machine translation model helped to set the scene for neural network approaches for machine it could not be demonstrated to achieve competitive results compared to traditional approaches. The compression of the sen- representation into a single vector is especially a problem for long sentences. the model was used successfully in candidate translations generated by traditional statistical machine translation systems. 13.7.

It is essentially the sequence-to- sequence attention that we described as the canonical neural machine translation but with the recurrent neural networks replaced by layers. We introduced convolutions in the previous section. The idea is to combine a short sequence of neighboring words into a single representation. To look at it in another a convolution encodes a word with its left and right in a limited window. Let us now describe in more detail what this means for the encoder and the decoder in the neural model. Encoder See Figure 13.43 for an illustration of the layers used in the encoder. For each input the state at each layer is informed by the corresponding state in the layer and its two neighbors. Note that these layers do not shorten the because we have a convolution centered around each using padding with zero for word positions that are out of bounds. we start with the input word Ex j and progress through a sequence of layer h at different depth d until a maximum depth D . h 0 E x j h f h d 1 k h d 1 k for d 0 d D The function f is a feed-forward with a residual connection from the corresponding previous layer state h d 1 . Note that even with a few the representation of a word h may only be informed by partial sentence context in contrast to the bi-directional recurrent neural networks in the canonical model. relevant context words in the input sentence that help with disambiguation may be outside this window. On the other there are computational advantages to this idea. All words at one depth can be processed in even combined into one massive tensor operation that can be on a GPU. 86 CHAPTER 13.

The decoder state is computed as a sequence of layers over the already predicted output words. Each state is also informed by the input context computed from the input sentence and attention. Decoder The decoder in the canonical model also has at its core a recurrent neural network. Recall its state progression in Equation 13.75 on page s i f s i 1 i 1 c i where s i is the encoder i 1 the embedding of the previous output and c i the input context. The version of this does not have recurrent decoder the does not depend on the previous state s i 1 but is conditioned on the sequence of the most recent previous words. s i f i i 1 c i these decoder convolutions may be just as the encoder layers. s 1 f i i 1 c i s f s d 1 1 s d 1 c i for d 0 d D See Figure 13.44 for an illustration of these equations. The main difference between the canonical neural machine translation model and this architecture is the conditioning of the states of the decoder. They are computed in a sequence of and also always the input context. Attention The attention mechanism is essentially unchanged from the canonical neural trans- model. Recall that is is based on an association a s i 1 h j between the word computed by the encoder h j and the previous state of the decoder s i 1 back to Equation 13.78 on page 13.7. ALTERNATE ARCHITECTURES 87 Since we still have such encoder and decoder states h and s 1 we use the same here. These association scores are normalized and used to compute a weighted sum of the input word the encoder states h A is that the encoder state h and the input word embedding x j is combined via addition when computing the context vector. This is the usual trick of using residual connections to assist training with deep neural networks. 13.7.3 Self-Attention The critique of the use of recurrent neural networks is that they require a lengthy word by of the entire input which is time-consuming and limits The previous sections replaced the recurrent neural networks in our canonical model with con- these have a limited context window to enrich representations of words. What we would like is some architectural component that allows us to use wide context and can be highly What could that In we already encountered the attention mechanism. It considers associations be- tween every input word and any output and uses it to build a vector representation of the entire input sequence. The idea behind self-attention is to extend this idea to the encoder. Instead of computing the association between an input and an output self-attention com- the association between any input word and any other input word. One way to view it is that this mechanism the representation of each input word by enriching it with context words that help to disambiguate it. Computing Self-Attention self attention for a sequence of vectors h j size h packed into a matrix H as self-attention H T h H Let us look at this equation in detail. The association between every word representation h j any other context word h k is done via the dot product between the packed matrix H and its transpose H T resulting in a vector of raw association values T . The values in this vector are scaled by the size of the word representation vectors h and then by the so that their values add up to 1. The resulting vector of normalized association values is then used to weigh the context words. Another way to put Equation 13.98 without the matrix H notation but using word vectors h j a 1 h j h T h exp a exp a j normalized association self-attention h j j h k weighted sum k h k raw association T 88 CHAPTER 13. NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Self-Attention Layer The self-attention step described above is only one step in the self- attention layer used to encode the input sentence. There are four more steps that follow it. We combine self-attention with residual connections that pass the word representation through directly self-attention h j h j Next up is a layer normalization step in Section 13.2.6 on page h j layer-normalization self-attention h j h j A standard feed-forward step with activation function is applied. W h j b This is also augmented with residual connections and layer normalization. layer-normalization W h j b h j Taking a page from deep we now stack several such layers D 6 on top of each other. h 0 Ex j start with input word embedding h self-attention-layer h d 1 for d 0 d D The deep modeling is the reason behind the residual connections in the self-attention layer such residual connections help with training since they allow a shortcut to the input which may be utilized in early stages of before it can take advantage of the more complex that deep models enable. The layer normalization step is one standard train- trick that also helps especially with deep models. Attention in the Decoder Self-attention is also used in the now between output words. The decoder also has more traditional attention. In total there are 3 sub layers. Self Output words are initially encoded by word s i i . We per- form exactly the same self-attention computation as described in Equation 13.98. How- the association of a word s i is limited to words s k with k i just the previously produced output words. Let us denote the result of this sub layer for output word i as s i The attention mechanism in this model follows very closely self-attention. The only difference is we compute self attention between the hidden states H and themselves. we compute attention between the decoder states S and the encoder states H . T attention H H h SH 13.7.

NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION Further Readings and build a comprehensive machine translation model by encoding the source sentence with a neural and then generate the target sentence by reversing the process. A of this was proposed by who use multiple layers in the encoder and the decoder that do not reduce the length of the encoded sequence but incorporate wider context with each layer. replace the recurrent neural networks used in sequence-to-sequence models with multiple self-attention both for the encoder as well as the decoder. There are a number of additional of this so-called multi-head encoding of sentence positions of etc. 13.8 Current Challenges Neural machine translation has emerged as the most promising machine translation approach in recent showing superior performance on public benchmarks and rapid adoption in deployments Google and But there have also been reports of poor such as the systems built under low-resource conditions in the LORELEI pro- gram. 8 we examine a number of challenges to neural machine translation and give empirical results on how well the technology currently holds compared to traditional statistical ma- chine translation. We show despite its recent neural machine translation still has to overcome various most notably performance out-of-domain and under low resource conditions. What a lot of the problems have in common is that the neural translation models do not show robust behavior when confronted with conditions that differ from training conditions may it be due to limited exposure to training unusual input in case of out- of-domain test or unlikely initial word choices in beam search. The solution to these problems may hence lie in a more general approach of training that steps outside optimizing single word predictions given perfectly matching prior sequences. Another challenge that we do not examine neural machine translation are much less The answer to the question of why the training data leads these systems to decide on word choices during decoding is buried in large matrices of real-numbered values. There is a clear need to develop better for neural machine translation. We use common for neural machine translation and traditional phrase- based statistical machine translation with common data drawn from and OPUS. Unless noted we use default such as beam search and single model decoding. The training data is processed with byte-pair encoding into to a 50,000 word vocabulary limit. 8 evaluations 13.8.

We use from the shared translation task organized alongside the Conference on Machine Translation 10 .

We expect that methods for domain adaptation will be developed for neural machine translation. A currently popular approach is to train a general domain followed by training on in-domain data for a few epochs and and large amounts of training data are only available out of but we still seek to have robust performance. To test how well neural machine translation and statistical machine translation hold we trained different systems using different corpora obtained from OPUS An additional system was trained on all the training data. Statistics about corpus sizes are shown in Table 13.3. Note that these domains are quite distant from each much more so TED News and Global Voices. We trained both statistical machine translation and neural machine translation systems for all domains. All systems were trained for with tuning and test sets sub- sampled from the data were not used in A common byte-pair encoding is used for all training runs. See Figure 13.46 for results. While the in-domain neural and statistical machine translation systems are similar machine translation is better for IT and statistical machine translation is better for and the out-of-domain performance for the machine translation systems is worse in almost all sometimes dramatically so.

In statistical machine translation we have previously observed that doubling the amount of training data gives a increase in scores. This holds true for both parallel and monolingual data Irvine and How do the data needs of statistical machine translation and neural machine translation Neural machine translation promises both to generalize better word sim- in and condition on larger context input and all prior output 94 CHAPTER 13.

The quality of systems holds up fairly even if large parts of the training data are corrupted in various such as aligned content in wrong badly translated etc. Statistical ma- chine translation models are built on probability distributions estimated from many occur- of words and phrases. Any unsystematic noise in the training only affects the tail end of the distribution. 13 Spanish was last represented in we used data from 96 CHAPTER 13.

Is this still the case for neural machine Chen considered one kind of misaligned sentence pairs in an experiments with a large parallel corpus. They the target side of part of the training so that these sentence pairs are Table 13.4 shows the result. Statistical machine translation systems hold up fairly well. Even with of the data the quality only drops from 32.7 to 32.0 about what is to be expected with half the valid training data. the neural machine translation system degrades from 35.4 to 30.1 a drop of 5.3 com- pared to the 0.7 point drop for statistical systems. A possible explanation for this poor behavior of neural machine translation models is that its prediction has to a good balance between language model and input context as the main driver. When training observes increasing ratios of training for which the input sen- is a meaningless it may generally learn to rely more on the output language model hence hallucinating by inadequate output. 13.8.4 Word Alignment The key contribution of the attention model in neural machine translation was the imposition of an alignment of the output words to the input words. This takes the shape of a probability distribution over the input words which is used to weigh them in a bag-of-words representation of the input sentence. this attention model does not functionally play the role of a word alignment between the source in the at least not in the same way as its analog in statistical machine translation. While in both alignment is a latent variable that is used to obtain probability distributions over words or arguably the attention model has a broader role. For when translating a attention may also be paid to its subject and object since these may disambiguate it. To further complicate the word representations are products of bidirectional gated recurrent neural networks that have the effect that each word representation is informed by the entire sentence context. But there is a clear need for an alignment mechanism between source and target words. For prior work used the alignments provided by the attention model to interpolate word translation decisions with traditional probabilistic dictionaries for the introduction of coverage and fertility models etc. 13.8.

We use incremental fast-align to align the input and output of the neural machine system. See Figure for an illustration. We compare the word attention states with the word alignments obtained with fast align For most these match up pretty well. Both attention states and fast-align alignment points are a bit fuzzy around the function words . the attention model may settle on alignments that do not correspond with our in- tuition or alignment points obtained with fast-align. See Figure for the reverse language All the alignment points appear to be off by one position. We are not aware of any intuitive explanation for this divergent behavior the translation quality is high for both systems. We measure how well the soft alignment of the neural machine system match the alignments of fast-align with two a match score that checks for each output if the aligned input word according to fast-align is indeed the input word that received the highest attention and a probability mass score that sums up the probability mass given to each alignment point obtained from fast-align. 98 CHAPTER 13.

Table 13.5 shows alignment scores for the systems. The results suggest while the divergence for is an outlier. We that we have seen such large a divergence also under different data conditions. Note that the attention model may produce better word alignments by guided alignment training where supervised word alignments as the ones produced by are provided to model training. 13.8.5 Beam Search The task of decoding is to the full sentence translation with the highest probability. In machine this problem has been addressed with heuristic search techniques that explore a subset of the space of possible translation. A common feature of these search techniques is a beam size parameter that limits the number of partial translations maintained per input word. There is typically a straightforward relationship between this beam size parameter and the model score of resulting translations and also their quality score While there are diminishing returns for increasing the beam typically improvements in these scores can be expected with larger beams. Decoding in neural translation models can be set up in similar fashion. When predicting the next output we may not only commit to the highest scoring word prediction but 14 neural machine translation operates on but fast-align is run on full words. If an input word is split into by byte pair then we add their attention scores. If an output word is split into then we take the average of their attention vectors. The match scores and probability mass scores are computed as average over output word-level scores. If an output word has no fast-align alignment it is ignored in this computation. If an output word is fast-aligned to multiple input then for the match count it as correct if the n aligned words among the top n highest scoring words according to attention and for the probability mass add up their attention scores. 15 13.8.

NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION also maintain the next best scoring words in a list of partial translations. We record with each partial translation the word translation probabilities from the extend each partial translation with subsequent word predictions and accumulate these scores. Since the number of partial translation explodes exponentially with each new output we prune them down to a beam of highest scoring partial translations. As in traditional statistical machine translation increasing the beam size allows us to explore a larger set of the space of possible translation and hence translations with better model scores. as Figure 13.51 increasing the beam size does not consistently improve translation quality. In in almost all worse translations are found beyond an optimal beam size setting are using again Edinburgh’s 2016 The optimal beam size varies from 4 to around 30 Normalizing sentence level model scores by length of the output alleviates the problem somewhat and also leads to better optimal quality in most cases of the 8 language pairs Optimal beam sizes are in the range of in almost all but quality still drops with larger beams. The main cause of deteriorating quality are shorter translations under wider beams. 13.8.6 Further Readings Other studies have looked at the comparable performance of neural and statistical machine translation systems. considered different linguistic categories for German and and compared different broad aspects such as and reordering for nine language directions. 13.9 Additional Topics Especially early work on neural networks for machine translation was aimed at building neural compo- to be used in traditional statistical machine translation systems. Translation Models By including aligned source words in the conditioning enrich a feed-forward neural network language model with source context add a sentence embedding to the conditional context of this which are learned using a variant of neural networks and mapping them across languages. use a more complex neural network to encode the input sentence that uses gated layers and also incorporates information about the output context. Reordering Models reordering models struggle with sparse data problems when con- on rich context. Li show that a neural reordering model can be conditioned on current and previous phrase pair with a recursive neural network to make the same decisions for orientation type. 13.9. ADDITIONAL TOPICS 101 Instead of handing reordering within the decoding we may the input sentence into output word order. use an input dependency tree to learn a model that swaps children nodes and implement it using a feed-forward neural network. and formulate a top-down left-to-right walk through the dependency tree and make reorder- decisions at any node. They model this process with a recurrent neural network that includes past decisions in the conditioning context. N-Gram Translation Models An alternative view of the phrase based translation model is to break up phrase translations into minimal translation and employing a n-gram model over these units to condition each minimal translation units on the previous ones. treat each minimal translation unit as an atomic symbol and train a neural language model over it. represent the minimal translation units as bag of break them even further into single input single output or single input-output word and and use phrase leaned with an auto-encoder. 102 CHAPTER 13.
